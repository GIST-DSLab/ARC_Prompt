Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the input grid that is being mirrored in the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the examples seems to be that the non-zero elements in the input grid are being mirrored along the vertical center line of the grid. This means that the elements on the left side of the grid are moved to the right side and vice versa, while maintaining their relative positions. The zero elements (empty spaces) are not moved.


Q2: Identify the position of the pattern in the input grid of the quiz.
A2: A2: The pattern in the input grid of the quiz is located in the last two rows. The elements 2, 3, and 8 are on the left side of the grid and the element 5 is on the right side of the grid.


Q3: Identify the position where the pattern should be mirrored in the output grid of the quiz.
A3: A3: The pattern should be mirrored along the vertical center line of the grid. This means that the elements 2, 3, and 8 should be moved to the right side of the grid and the element 5 should be moved to the left side of the grid. The relative positions of the elements should be maintained.


Q4: Mirror the pattern from the input grid to the output grid in the quiz.
A4: A4: The mirrored output grid should look like this:

Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid in the examples is as follows:

1. The input grid is expanded to three times its original size in both dimensions (rows and columns). The original grid is replicated in a 3x3 pattern in the expanded grid.

2. The values in the expanded grid are then rearranged according to the following rules:
   - The values in the top left quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the top right quadrant of the original grid.
   - The values in the top right quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the bottom right quadrant of the original grid.
   - The values in the bottom left quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the top left quadrant of the original grid.
   - The values in the bottom right quadrant of the expanded grid are taken from the bottom left quadrant of the original grid.

3. The values in the middle row and middle column of the expanded grid are set to 0.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a 9x9 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 9x9 grid, which is three times the size of the input 3x3 grid. This is part of the transformation pattern identified in the examples.

Quiz Answer:
If the input grid is 
[[0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0]],
then the output grid would be
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]].


Q3: Observe that the input grid is replicated in a 3x3 pattern to form the output grid.
A3: A3: Yes, the input grid is indeed replicated in a 3x3 pattern to form the output grid. However, the values are rearranged according to the rules identified in the pattern. This includes moving values from one quadrant to another and setting the values in the middle row and middle column to 0. This transformation pattern is consistent across all the examples provided.


Q4: Identify the transformation of the individual cells in the input grid to their corresponding 3x3 blocks in the output grid.
A4: A4: The transformation of the individual cells in the input grid to their corresponding 3x3 blocks in the output grid is as follows:

- The cell in the top left corner of the input grid is transformed into the bottom left 3x3 block in the output grid.
- The cell in the top right corner of the input grid is transformed into the top left 3x3 block in the output grid.
- The cell in the bottom left corner of the input grid is transformed into the bottom right 3x3 block in the output grid.
- The cell in the bottom right corner of the input grid is transformed into the top right 3x3 block in the output grid.
- The cells in the middle row and middle column of the input grid are transformed into the middle row and middle column of the output grid, but all their values are set to 0.


Q5: Apply the transformation rules identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A5: A5: Applying the transformation rules identified in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

Q2: Identify the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the input grid.
A2: A2: The pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the input grid is that they are arranged in a straight line in the middle of the grid, with each number separated by a 0. The order from left to right is 2, 8, 3, 6.


Q3: Determine the relationship between the pattern of 1s and the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8.
A3: A3: The relationship between the pattern of 1s and the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 is that the pattern of 1s is used as a template or mold to shape the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the output grid. Each number in the line (2, 3, 6, 8) fills the square pattern of 1s, one at a time, from top to bottom in the output grid.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========
Q1: Identify the two distinct patterns of 1s in the input grid.
A1: The two distinct patterns of 1s in the input grid are:

1. A square pattern of 1s in the top left and bottom right corners of the grid. This square pattern has a side length of 5 and a single 0 in the center.

2. A cross pattern of 1s in the center of the grid. This cross pattern has a length of 5 and a width of 1.


Q2: For each pattern, identify the 5x5 square that contains the pattern.
A2: A2: For each pattern, the 5x5 square that contains the pattern is as follows:

1. For the square pattern of 1s, the 5x5 squares are located at the top left corner (rows 1-5, columns 1-5) and the bottom right corner (rows 15-19, columns 15-19) of the grid.

2. For the cross pattern of 1s, the 5x5 square is located in the center of the grid (rows 8-12, columns 8-12).


Q3: For each 5x5 square, create a new grid that only contains the pattern and the surrounding 0s.
A3: A3: For each 5x5 square, the new grid that only contains the pattern and the surrounding 0s is as follows:

1. For the square pattern of 1s:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

2. For the cross pattern of 1s:
[[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]


Q4: For each new grid, remove the rows and columns that only contain 0s.
A4: A4: For each new grid, after removing the rows and columns that only contain 0s, we get:

1. For the square pattern of 1s, the grid remains the same as there are no rows or columns that only contain 0s:
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

2. For the cross pattern of 1s, after removing the rows and columns that only contain 0s, we get:
[[1], 
 [1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1], 
 [1]]


Q5: Combine the two grids to form the final output grid.
A5: A5: The final output grid is formed by combining the two grids. The output grid is as follows:

[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of the input grid.
A1: The pattern of the input grid is that it consists of several squares of different colors, each square is separated by a row or column of zeros. Each square has a border of a specific color and the inside of the square is filled with zeros, except for one row or column that is filled with the same color as the border.


Q2: Identify the changes between the input and output grids in the examples.
A2: A2: The changes between the input and output grids in the examples are that the row or column inside each square that is filled with the same color as the border, is mirrored or flipped. The position of the colored row or column inside the square in the output grid is the mirror image of its position in the input grid.


Q3: Identify the squares in the input grid of the quiz that need to be filled based on the pattern identified in Q1.
A3: A3: The squares in the input grid of the quiz that need to be filled based on the pattern identified in Q1 are the squares with the colors 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8. Each of these squares has a row or column inside the square that is filled with the same color as the border, and these rows or columns need to be mirrored or flipped according to the pattern.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of 4s in the input grid.
A1: A1: The pattern of 4s in the input grid forms a diamond shape. The diamond is symmetrical both vertically and horizontally. The diamond is located in the center of the grid.


Q2: Determine the transformation rule from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A2: A2: The transformation rule from the input grid to the output grid seems to be a reflection of the diamond shape along both the vertical and horizontal axes. The diamond shape is duplicated and reflected to the right and bottom of the original shape, creating a larger diamond shape in the output grid. The original diamond shape remains in the output grid.


Q3: Apply the transformation rule to the pattern of 4s in the input grid of the quiz.
A3: A3: The transformation rule applied to the pattern of 4s in the input grid of the quiz would result in a larger diamond shape in the output grid. The original diamond shape would be duplicated and reflected to the right and bottom of the original shape. The original diamond shape would remain in the output grid. The output grid would look like this:

then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern of transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples seems to be a color change of the objects in the grid. The objects are represented by the number 8 in the input grid. In the output grid, the objects are represented by different numbers (1, 2, 3, 7) depending on their position and shape in the grid. 

In Example 1, the object at the top left corner changes to 1, the object at the top right corner changes to 3, the object at the bottom left corner changes to 2, and the object at the bottom right corner changes to 7.

In Example 2, the object at the top left corner changes to 2, the object at the top right corner changes to 3, the object at the bottom left corner changes to 7, and the object at the bottom right corner changes to 1.

In Example 3, the object at the top left corner changes to 3, the object at the top right corner changes to 7, the object at the bottom left corner changes to 1, and the object at the bottom right corner changes to 2.

So, the pattern seems to be a color change of the objects depending on their position and shape in the grid.


Q2: Notice that the transformation involves changing the color of the cells that form a specific pattern.
A2: A2: Yes, the transformation involves changing the color of the cells that form a specific pattern. The pattern seems to be based on the position and shape of the objects in the grid. The objects in the corners of the grid are changed to different colors in the output grid. The color change is represented by different numbers in the output grid.


Q3: Identify the cells in the input grid of the quiz that form the same pattern.
A3: A3: In the quiz input grid, the cells that form the same pattern as the examples are the cells with the number 8. These cells form four distinct objects in the grid. The object at the top left corner, the object at the top right corner, the object at the bottom left corner, and the object at the bottom right corner.


Q4: Apply the same transformation to these cells in the quiz input grid to generate the output grid.
A4: A4: Applying the same transformation to the quiz input grid, the output grid would be:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the input and output grids of the examples.
A1: The pattern in the input and output grids of the examples is that the output grid is a smaller section of the input grid. The output grid is always a square and is located in the center of the input grid. The size of the output grid depends on the size of the input grid. If the input grid is 30x30, the output grid is 7x7. If the input grid is 20x20, the output grid is 5x5. If the input grid is 10x10, the output grid is 3x3.


Q2: Notice that the output grids are always 4x4, regardless of the size of the input grid.
A2: A2: Actually, the output grids are not always 4x4. The size of the output grid depends on the size of the input grid. For example, if the input grid is 30x30, the output grid is 7x7. If the input grid is 20x20, the output grid is 5x5. If the input grid is 10x10, the output grid is 3x3.


Q3: Identify the specific 4x4 section of the input grid that is transformed into the output grid.
A3: A3: The specific section of the input grid that is transformed into the output grid is the center of the input grid. The output grid is a square that is centered in the input grid. The size of this square depends on the size of the input grid. For example, if the input grid is 30x30, the output grid is a 7x7 square in the center of the input grid. If the input grid is 20x20, the output grid is a 5x5 square in the center, and so on.


Q4: Determine the rule or transformation that is applied to this 4x4 section to produce the output grid.
A4: A4: The rule or transformation applied to the section of the input grid to produce the output grid is simply extraction. No changes are made to the values or arrangement of the cells in the section. The section is directly extracted from the input grid and presented as the output grid.


Q5: Apply this rule or transformation to the corresponding 4x4 section of the input grid in the quiz to produce the output grid.
A5: A5: The input grid in the quiz is 30x30, so the output grid will be a 7x7 square in the center of the input grid. The output grid is:

[[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], 
 [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], 
 [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], 
 [8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8], 
 [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], 
 [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], 
 [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]]

","A5: The input grid in the quiz is 30x30, so the output grid will be a 7x7 square in the center of the input grid. The output grid is:

[[9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9],

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],

Q1: Identify the area in the input grid that is surrounded by the number 3.
A1: A1: The area in the input grid that is surrounded by the number 3 is the area filled with the number 8. This area is a square shape located in the middle of the grid, specifically from the 8th row to the 11th row and from the 7th column to the 11th column.


Q2: Identify the number that is inside the area surrounded by the number 3.
A2: A2: The number that is inside the area surrounded by the number 3 is 8.


Q3: Replace the number 0 outside the area surrounded by the number 3 with the number identified in Q2.
A3: A3: If we replace the number 0 outside the area surrounded by the number 3 with the number identified in Q2 (which is 8), the output grid will be as follows:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

A2: A2: There are no 1s in the rows identified in Q1. The rows containing the number 2 only have 2s and 0s.


Q3: If there are 1s in the row, identify the pattern of 1s.
A3: A3: As there are no 1s in the rows identified in Q2, there is no pattern of 1s to identify in those rows.


Q4: If the pattern of 1s is two 1s followed by a 0, replace the 0 with a 1.
A4: A4: As there are no 1s in the rows identified in Q2, there is no pattern of 1s to identify and no 0s to replace with a 1 in those rows. However, in the rows that do contain 1s, the pattern is two 1s followed by a 0. In these rows, the 0 that follows two 1s should be replaced with a 1. 

So, the output grids should be:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]


Q5: If the pattern of 1s is a single 1 followed by a 0, leave the 0 as it is.
A5: A5: In the rows that contain 1s, there are no instances of a single 1 followed by a 0. Therefore, there are no 0s that need to be left as they are based on this pattern.


Q6: Repeat this process for all rows identified in Q1.
A6: A6: The process has been repeated for all rows identified in Q1. The rows containing the number 2 have been left unchanged, and in the rows containing 1s, the 0 that follows two 1s has been replaced with a 1. The final output grid is as follows:

Q7: The output grid is the input grid with the modifications made in Q4 and Q5.
A7: A7: Yes, the output grid is the input grid with the modifications made in Q4 and Q5. The modifications are based on the pattern of 1s in each row. If the pattern is two 1s followed by a 0, the 0 is replaced with a 1. If the pattern is a single 1 followed by a 0, the 0 is left as it is. The rows containing the number 2 are left unchanged.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of numbers in the input grid.
A1: The pattern in the input grid is as follows:

1. The first two rows and the first two columns are filled with 1s.
2. The third row and the third column are filled with 4s.
3. Starting from the fourth row and the fourth column, the numbers are arranged in a certain sequence. The sequence is [3, 2, 1, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7] and it repeats itself.
4. There are certain blocks of 0s in the grid. These blocks are located in the middle of the grid and they are surrounded by the sequence of numbers. The size and position of these blocks vary in different examples.


Q2: Identify the areas in the grid where the pattern is interrupted by zeros.
A2: A2: The pattern is interrupted by zeros in certain blocks within the grid. These blocks are located in the middle of the grid and are surrounded by the sequence of numbers. The size and position of these blocks vary in different examples. For instance, in the quiz example, there are three blocks of zeros. The first block starts from the 12th column of the 4th row and ends at the 18th column of the 7th row. The second block starts from the 2nd column of the 9th row and ends at the 8th column of the 14th row. The third block starts from the 9th column of the 15th row and ends at the 15th column of the 20th row.


Q3: Determine the pattern of numbers that should replace the zeros.
A3: A3: The pattern of numbers that should replace the zeros is the same sequence of numbers that is present in the rest of the grid. This sequence is [3, 2, 1, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7] and it repeats itself. The sequence should continue from where it was interrupted by the zeros. For instance, if the sequence was interrupted after the number 5, it should continue with the number 7 after the block of zeros.


Q4: Replace the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers to match the rest of the grid.
A4: A4: The output grid after replacing the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers is as follows:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

A1: The unique colors in the grid are 0, 3, 4, and 8.


Q2: For each color, find the smallest rectangle that can cover all the cells of that color.
A2: A2: 
For color 0, the smallest rectangle is the entire grid itself.
For color 3, the smallest rectangle starts at (1,1) and ends at (15,14).
For color 4, the smallest rectangle starts at (5,4) and ends at (14,5).
For color 8, the smallest rectangle starts at (0,6) and ends at (3,15).


Q3: For each rectangle found in Q2, check if there are any other colors inside the rectangle.
A3: A3: 
For the rectangle of color 3, there are no other colors inside.
For the rectangle of color 4, there are no other colors inside.
For the rectangle of color 8, there are colors 0 and 3 inside.


Q4: If there are no other colors inside the rectangle, keep the rectangle.
A4: A4: The rectangles of color 3 and 4 have no other colors inside, so we keep these rectangles. 

Q5: For each kept rectangle, create a new grid of the same size as the rectangle, filled with the color of the rectangle.
A5: 
For color 3, the new grid is [[3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]].
For color 4, the new grid is [[4, 4], [4, 4], [4, 4], [4, 4]].

Q1: Identify the pattern in the input and output grids of the examples.
A1: A1: The pattern in the input and output grids is that the 2x2 input grid is expanded to a 6x6 output grid. Each 2x2 block in the output grid is a copy of the input grid, and the blocks alternate between being a direct copy and a mirrored copy (flipped along the vertical axis).


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a 6x6 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 6x6 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions. This is part of the pattern - the input grid is expanded by replicating it both horizontally and vertically. The replication also includes a mirroring effect, where every alternate block is a mirrored version of the input grid.


Q3: Observe that the output grid is formed by repeating the input grid three times horizontally.
A3: A3: Yes, the output grid is formed by repeating the input grid three times horizontally. However, it's important to note that every alternate repetition is a mirrored version of the input grid. This pattern is also repeated vertically, resulting in a 6x6 grid. 

Quiz Answer: 
[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]


Q4: Also, notice that the output grid is formed by repeating the input grid and its transpose alternately three times vertically.
A4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The output grid is formed by repeating the input grid and its mirrored version alternately three times vertically. This pattern of alternating between the original and mirrored version of the input grid is repeated both horizontally and vertically, resulting in the final 6x6 output grid.


Q5: Apply the same pattern to the quiz input grid.
A5: A5: Applying the same pattern to the quiz input grid, we get the following output grid:

[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]

Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid is as follows:

1. The input grid is a 3x3 matrix. The output grid is a 9x9 matrix.

2. The first three rows of the output grid are a repetition of the input grid rows three times.

3. The next three rows of the output grid are also a repetition of the input grid rows three times.

4. The last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros.

So, the output grid is essentially the input grid repeated twice vertically, followed by a 3x9 matrix of zeros.


Q2: Notice that the input grid is repeated three times horizontally and vertically in the output grid.
A2: A2: Yes, the input grid is repeated three times horizontally in the first six rows of the output grid. However, it is only repeated twice vertically, as the last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros.

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is [[6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3]], then the output grid would be:

[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], 
 [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], 
 [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], 
 [6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], 
 [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], 
 [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]


Q3: Observe that the repeated grids are separated by rows and columns of zeros.
A3: A3: Yes, that's correct. However, in this particular pattern, the repeated grids are not separated by rows or columns of zeros. Instead, the last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros. This creates a kind of ""padding"" at the bottom of the output grid.


Q4: Apply this pattern to the input grid of the quiz.
A4: A4: Applying the pattern to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], 
 [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3],

Q5: Insert rows and columns of zeros between the repeated grids to match the pattern observed in the examples.
A5: A5: In this particular pattern, we do not insert rows or columns of zeros between the repeated grids. Instead, the last three rows of the output grid are filled with zeros. This creates a kind of ""padding"" at the bottom of the output grid. So, the output grid for the quiz would be:

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the input grid that is repeated in the output grid.
A1: The pattern in the input grid that is repeated in the output grid is that the non-zero elements in the input grid are duplicated and moved to the bottom of the grid in the output grid. The number of times the elements are duplicated and moved depends on the number of zero rows below the row containing the non-zero elements in the input grid. The non-zero elements maintain their original order and position within the row.


Q2: Identify the changes that occur from the input grid to the output grid.
A2: A2: The changes that occur from the input grid to the output grid are that the non-zero elements in the input grid are duplicated and moved to the bottom of the grid in the output grid. The number of times the elements are duplicated and moved depends on the number of zero rows below the row containing the non-zero elements in the input grid. The non-zero elements maintain their original order and position within the row.

Q3: How would you describe the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in words?
A3: The transformation from the input grid to the output grid can be described as follows: For each row in the input grid, if the row contains non-zero elements, these elements are duplicated and moved to the bottom of the grid in the output grid. The number of times the elements are duplicated and moved depends on the number of zero rows below the row containing the non-zero elements in the input grid. The non-zero elements maintain their original order and position within the row.

Q4: What is the output grid for the quiz?
A4: The output grid for the quiz is:
[[5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]].


Q3: Determine the rule for when and where these changes occur.
A3: A3: The rule for when and where these changes occur is as follows: For each row in the input grid, if the row contains non-zero elements, these elements are duplicated and moved to the bottom of the grid in the output grid. The number of times the elements are duplicated and moved depends on the number of zero rows below the row containing the non-zero elements in the input grid. The non-zero elements maintain their original order and position within the row.


Q4: Apply this rule to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A4: A4: Applying the rule to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

[[5, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]].

Q1: Identify the pattern of the input grid.
A1: The pattern of the input grid is that it is divided into three equal parts horizontally. The first part is filled with zeros, the second part is filled with fives, and the third part is filled with zeros again. However, in each part, there is one cell that is filled with the number from the adjacent part.


Q2: Identify the pattern of the output grid in the examples.
A2: A2: The pattern of the output grid is that it is also divided into three equal parts horizontally. However, the numbers in the output grid are different from the input grid. The first part is filled with the number of non-zero cells in the third part of the input grid, the second part is filled with the number of non-zero cells in the first part of the input grid, and the third part is filled with the number of non-zero cells in the second part of the input grid.


Q3: Identify the relationship between the input and output grids.
A3: A3: The relationship between the input and output grids is that the number in each part of the output grid corresponds to the count of non-zero cells in the corresponding part of the input grid. Specifically, the number in the first part of the output grid is the count of non-zero cells in the third part of the input grid, the number in the second part of the output grid is the count of non-zero cells in the first part of the input grid, and the number in the third part of the output grid is the count of non-zero cells in the second part of the input grid.

So, for the quiz, the output grid would be:
[[4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]


Q4: Count the number of 5s in each part of the input grid in the quiz.
A4: A4: In the first part of the input grid, there are no 5s. In the second part, there is one 5. In the third part, there are four 5s.


Q5: Fill each part of the output grid with the number determined by the count of 5s in the corresponding part of the input grid.
A5: A5: The first part of the output grid should be filled with the number 4, which is the count of 5s in the third part of the input grid. The second part should be filled with the number 0, which is the count of 5s in the first part of the input grid. The third part should be filled with the number 1, which is the count of 5s in the second part of the input grid. So, the output grid would be:
[[4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]]

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Q1: Identify the positions of the number 1 in the input grid.
A1: A1: The number 1 is located at the following positions in the input grid: (0,0), (3,3), (6,6).


Q2: For each position of 1, calculate the position that is three steps to the right.
A2: A2: For each position of 1, the position that is three steps to the right are: (0,3), (3,6), (6,9).


Q3: Check if the calculated position is within the grid boundaries.
A3: A3: Yes, all the calculated positions (0,3), (3,6), (6,9) are within the grid boundaries.


Q4: If the calculated position is within the grid boundaries, replace the number at that position with 2.
A4: A4: Yes, if the calculated position is within the grid boundaries, we replace the number at that position with 2. So the output grid will be:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of the number 2 in the input grid.
A1: The pattern of the number 2 in the input grid is that it forms a shape of the number 8. The number 2 is arranged in such a way that it forms the vertical and horizontal lines of the number 8. The number 8 is repeated in the grid multiple times, both in the upper and lower parts of the grid.


Q2: Identify the pattern of the number 3 in the input grid.
A2: A2: The pattern of the number 3 in the input grid is that it forms a solid block in the middle of the grid. The number 3 is arranged in such a way that it forms a rectangle, filling the entire rows for a certain section of the grid.


Q3: Identify the pattern of the number 0 in the input grid.
A3: A3: The pattern of the number 0 in the input grid is that it fills the spaces not occupied by the number 2 or 3. It also forms the spaces inside the number 8 pattern formed by the number 2. In addition, there are entire rows filled with the number 0, separating the patterns of 2 and 3.


Q4: Identify the pattern of the number 8 in the output grid.
A4: A4: The pattern of the number 8 in the output grid is that it replaces the number 2 in the input grid where the number 2 forms the corners of the number 8 shape. The number 8 is placed in the positions where the vertical and horizontal lines of the number 8 shape intersect.


Q5: Identify the relationship between the patterns of the number 2 in the input grid and the number 8 in the output grid.
A5: A5: The relationship between the patterns of the number 2 in the input grid and the number 8 in the output grid is that the number 8 replaces the number 2 at the corners of the number 8 shape. The number 8 is placed where the vertical and horizontal lines of the number 8 shape intersect. The rest of the number 2's remain the same in the output grid.


Q6: Apply the relationship identified in Q5 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that each row and column of the input grid is duplicated in the output grid. This results in an output grid that is twice as large as the input grid in both dimensions. The values in the cells of the output grid are the same as the corresponding cells in the input grid.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a larger version of the input grid, with each cell in the input grid being represented by a 2x2 square in the output grid.
A2: A2: Yes, that's correct. Each cell in the input grid is represented by a 2x2 square in the output grid. This means that the output grid is twice as large as the input grid in both dimensions. 

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is 
[[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]],
then the output grid will be 
[[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]].


Q3: Determine the rule for transforming a single cell in the input grid to a 2x2 square in the output grid.
A3: A3: The rule for transforming a single cell in the input grid to a 2x2 square in the output grid is simple. The value of the single cell in the input grid is copied to all four cells in the corresponding 2x2 square in the output grid. This means that each cell in the input grid is represented by a 2x2 square of identical cells in the output grid.


Q4: Apply this rule to each cell in the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A4: A4: If we apply this rule to each cell in the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], 
 [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],

 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].

Each cell in the input grid has been transformed into a 2x2 square in the output grid with the same value.

","A4: If we apply this rule to each cell in the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], 
 [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========

Example 1
If input grids are like that
[[6, 2, 4, 2], [2, 2, 6, 6], [6, 4, 2, 4]],
then this grids change to output grids below

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples is that the input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically to form the output grid. 

In other words, the output grid is formed by first appending a horizontally flipped version of the input grid to the right of the original input grid. Then, a vertically flipped version of the resulting grid is appended below. 

For example, in Example 1, the input grid is:

[[6, 2, 4, 2], 
 [2, 2, 6, 6], 
 [6, 4, 2, 4]]

The horizontally mirrored version of this grid is:

[[2, 4, 2, 6], 
 [6, 6, 2, 2], 
 [4, 2, 4, 6]]

Appending this to the right of the original input grid gives:

[[6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6], 
 [2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2], 
 [6, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 6]]

The vertically mirrored version of this grid is:

[[6, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 6], 
 [2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2], 
 [6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6]]

Appending this below the previous grid gives the final output grid:

[[6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6], 
 [2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2], 
 [6, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 6], 
 [6, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 6], 
 [2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2], 
 [6, 2, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6]]


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that the values in the input grid are reflected along the central vertical and horizontal axes to form the output grid.

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is:
[[8, 5, 7, 8], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5]]

Then the output grid, following the pattern identified, would be:

[[8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8]]


Q3: Apply the same transformation to the quiz input grid.
A3: A3: If we apply the same transformation to the quiz input grid:

[[8, 5, 7, 8], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5]]

First, we mirror the grid horizontally:

[[8, 7, 5, 8], 
 [8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [5, 8, 5, 5]]

Then, we append this to the right of the original input grid:

[[8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5]]

Next, we mirror the resulting grid vertically:

[[5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8]]

Finally, we append this below the previous grid to get the final output grid:

[[8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8]]


Q4: Mirror the input grid horizontally and vertically to generate the output grid.
A4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves mirroring the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that the values in the input grid are reflected along the central vertical and horizontal axes to form the output grid. 

For the quiz input grid:

[[8, 5, 7, 8], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5]]

The horizontally mirrored version of this grid is:

[[8, 7, 5, 8], 
 [8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [5, 8, 5, 5]]

Appending this to the right of the original input grid gives:

[[8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5]]

The vertically mirrored version of this grid is:

[[5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8]]

Appending this below the previous grid gives the final output grid:

[[8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], 
 [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], 
 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [8, 5, 7, 8, 8, 7, 5, 8]]

","A4: Yes, that's correct. The transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves mirroring the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that the values in the input grid are reflected along the central vertical and horizontal axes to form the output grid. 

For the quiz input grid:

[[8, 5, 7, 8],

The horizontally mirrored version of this grid is:

[[8, 7, 5, 8], 
 [8, 8, 7, 7], 
 [5, 8, 5, 5]]

Appending this to the right of the original input grid gives:

 [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7],

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the positions of the number 2 and 3 in the input grid.
A1: The number 2 is located at the following positions in the input grid:
(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)

The number 3 is located at the following positions in the input grid:
(1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,3)


Q2: Determine the pattern of the number 2 and 3 in the input grid.
A2: A2: The pattern of the number 2 and 3 in the input grid is that they form a sort of mirrored pattern with each other. The number 2 forms a shape that is mirrored along the vertical axis, and the number 3 forms a shape that is mirrored along the horizontal axis. The number 2 is located at the top and bottom of the grid, while the number 3 is located at the left and right of the grid. 

Q3: Apply the pattern to the output grid.
A3: The pattern in the output grid is that the shapes formed by the number 2 and 3 in the input grid are moved towards the center of the grid. The shape formed by the number 2 is moved down and the shape formed by the number 3 is moved to the right. 

So, the output grid would be:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]


Q3: Identify the transformation of the number 2 and 3 from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A3: A3: The transformation of the number 2 and 3 from the input grid to the output grid in the examples involves moving the shapes formed by these numbers towards the center of the grid. The shape formed by the number 2 is moved down and the shape formed by the number 3 is moved to the right. This transformation is consistent across all the examples.


Q4: Apply the transformation identified in Q3 to the positions of the number 2 and 3 in the quiz input grid.
A4: A4: Applying the transformation identified in Q3 to the positions of the number 2 and 3 in the quiz input grid, we get the following output grid:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]


Q5: Replace the positions of the number 2 and 3 in the quiz input grid with the transformed positions from Q4 to generate the output grid.
A5: A5: Replacing the positions of the number 2 and 3 in the quiz input grid with the transformed positions from Q4, we get the following output grid:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Q1: Identify the pattern of transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern of transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples seems to be based on the count of the number 8 in each row and column. The output grid is a 4x5 grid where each cell represents the count of the number 8 in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. 

For example, in the first row of the first example, there are two 8's in the row and two 8's in the column, so the first cell of the output grid is 2. In the second row, there are three 8's in the row and two 8's in the column, so the second cell of the output grid is 2. This pattern continues for the rest of the grid. 

The same pattern applies to the other examples as well. The output grid is always a 4x5 grid, and each cell represents the count of the number 8 in the corresponding row and column of the input grid.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is always 4 columns wide.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always 4 columns wide. This is because the transformation pattern involves counting the number of 8's in each row and column of the input grid, and the input grid always has 4 columns that contain the number 8. Therefore, the output grid will always have 4 columns, regardless of the size or shape of the input grid.


Q3: Observe that the values in the output grid are determined by the values in the input grid.
A3: A3: Yes, the values in the output grid are directly determined by the values in the input grid. Specifically, each value in the output grid represents the count of the number 8 in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. This means that the values in the output grid are directly dependent on the distribution and frequency of the number 8 in the input grid. 

For example, if a row or column in the input grid has no 8's, the corresponding cell in the output grid will be 0. If a row or column in the input grid has one 8, the corresponding cell in the output grid will be 1, and so on. This pattern applies to all cells in the output grid, and is consistent across all examples. 

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is 
[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], 
 [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], 
 [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], 
 [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]],

then the output grid will be 
[[0, 2, 2, 0], 
 [0, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [0, 2, 2, 2]].


Q4: Determine the rule for transforming the values.
A4: A4: The rule for transforming the values from the input grid to the output grid is as follows:

1. For each cell in the output grid, count the number of 8's in the corresponding row and column in the input grid.
2. The value of the cell in the output grid is the minimum of the count of 8's in the corresponding row and column in the input grid.
3. Repeat this process for all cells in the output grid.

This rule is consistent across all examples and will always result in a 4x5 output grid, regardless of the size or shape of the input grid.


Q5: Apply these observations to transform the input grid of the quiz into the output grid.
A5: A5: Applying the observations and rules identified above, we can transform the input grid of the quiz into the output grid as follows:

Input grid:
[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], 
 [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], 
 [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], 
 [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]]

Count the number of 8's in each row and column:
[[0, 2, 2, 0], 
 [0, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [0, 2, 2, 2]]

So, the output grid is:
[[0, 2, 2, 0], 
 [0, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [0, 2, 2, 2]]

","A5: Applying the observations and rules identified above, we can transform the input grid of the quiz into the output grid as follows:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Q1: Identify the positions of the non-zero numbers in the input grid.
A1: The positions of the non-zero numbers in the input grid are as follows:

- The number 8 is at position (3, 3).
- The number 2 is at position (5, 7).
- The number 1 is at position (10, 12).

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

A1: The ARC problem is a type of problem in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a dataset introduced by François Chollet, the creator of the Keras deep learning library. The ARC problem involves identifying patterns in a given input grid and applying these patterns to transform the grid into a specified output grid.

In the given problem, the pattern seems to involve identifying cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 6s and transforming these cells in a certain way to produce the output grid. However, without more specific examples or instructions, it's difficult to determine exactly what transformations should be applied to these cells. 

For example, in the given input grid, the cells surrounded by 6s could be those in the middle of the grid, as the outermost rows and columns are all filled with 6s. But without knowing what should be done with these cells, we can't produce an output grid. 

In general, solving an ARC problem involves carefully studying the provided examples to understand the transformations that should be applied to the input grid. This often involves identifying patterns related to the colors and positions of cells in the grid. Once the pattern is understood, it can be applied to new input grids to produce the correct output grids.


Q2: Change the color of the cells identified in Q1 to the color of the cell that is located at the same position in the 4th row from the bottom of the grid.
A2: A2: To solve this problem, we need to identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 6s and then change the color of these cells to the color of the cell that is located at the same position in the 4th row from the bottom of the grid. 

However, without a specific algorithm or code, it's difficult to provide the exact output. In general, this would involve iterating over each cell in the input grid, checking the surrounding cells to see if they are all 6s, and if so, changing the color of the cell to match the corresponding cell in the 4th row from the bottom.

Here is a general idea of how you might implement this in Python:

```python
# Assume input_grid is a 2D list representing the input grid
output_grid = [row.copy() for row in input_grid]  # Start with a copy of the input grid

# Iterate over each cell in the grid
for i in range(1, len(input_grid) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(input_grid[i]) - 1):
        # Check if the cell is surrounded by 6s
        if all(input_grid[x][y] == 6 for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]):
            # Change the color of the cell in the output grid
            output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[-4][j]

# output_grid now contains the transformed grid
```

This code assumes that the input grid is surrounded by a border of 6s, as in the examples provided. If this is not the case, you would need to adjust the code to correctly identify cells that are surrounded by 6s.

Q1: Identify the pattern of the input grid.
A1: The pattern in the input grid seems to be a 13x4 grid with three distinct sections. The first section consists of six rows with numbers 0, 2, and occasionally other numbers. The second section is a single row of the number 7. The third section consists of six rows with numbers 0, 6, and occasionally other numbers. The numbers 2 and 6 seem to form various patterns within their respective sections.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a smaller version of the input grid, with the row of 7s removed and the 2s and 6s replaced with 8s.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a 6x4 grid where the row of 7s from the input grid is removed. The numbers 2 and 6 from the input grid are replaced with 8s in the output grid. The pattern of 8s in the output grid seems to mirror the pattern of 2s and 6s in the input grid. 

Q3: What is the transformation rule from the input grid to the output grid?
A3: The transformation rule appears to be as follows: 
1. Remove the row of 7s from the input grid.
2. Replace the numbers 2 and 6 in the remaining rows with 8s.
3. The pattern of 8s in the output grid should mirror the pattern of 2s and 6s in the input grid.

Q4: What is the output grid for the quiz?
A4: Applying the transformation rule to the quiz input grid, the output grid should be:
[[0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8], [8, 8, 0, 8]].


Q3: Identify the pattern of transformation from the input grid to the output grid.
A3: A3: The transformation pattern from the input grid to the output grid seems to be as follows: 
1. Remove the row of 7s from the input grid.
2. Replace the numbers 2 and 6 in the remaining rows with 8s.
3. The pattern of 8s in the output grid should mirror the pattern of 2s and 6s in the input grid.


Q4: Apply this transformation to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A4: A4: Applying the transformation rule to the quiz input grid, the output grid should be:

If input grids are like that
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 3, 3, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]],
then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the locations of the 3s in the input grid.
A1: A1: The locations of the 3s in the input grid are at the following coordinates: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (4,4), (5,0), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1).


Q2: Identify the locations of the 2s in the input grid.
A2: A2: The locations of the 2s in the input grid are at the following coordinates: (3,0), (6,3), (6,4), (7,3), (7,4).


Q3: Determine the number of 3s and 2s in the input grid.
A3: A3: The number of 3s in the input grid is 9 and the number of 2s is 5.


Q4: Create a 3x3 output grid.
A4: A4: The output grid would be [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]].


Q5: If there are more 3s than 2s, place a 1 in the top left corner of the output grid.
A5: A5: Yes, there are more 3s than 2s in the input grid. So, we place a 1 in the top left corner of the output grid.


Q6: If there are 3s in the top half of the input grid, place a 1 in the middle of the output grid.
A6: A6: No, there are no 3s in the top half of the input grid. So, we do not place a 1 in the middle of the output grid.


Q7: If there are 2s in the bottom half of the input grid, place a 1 in the middle of the output grid.
A7: A7: Yes, there are 2s in the bottom half of the input grid. So, we place a 1 in the bottom right corner of the output grid.


Q8: Fill the rest of the output grid with 0s.
A8: A8: Yes, the rest of the output grid is filled with 0s. So, the final output grid is [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]].

","A8: Yes, the rest of the output grid is filled with 0s. So, the final output grid is [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]].","[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]","[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]","[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]",FALSE,

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the input grid.
A1: The pattern in the input grid is a repeating sequence of numbers in each row. The sequence is repeated after a certain number of columns. However, there are some rows where the sequence is interrupted by a series of zeros.


Q2: Identify the changes in the output grid compared to the input grid.
A2: A2: The changes in the output grid compared to the input grid are that the series of zeros in the input grid are replaced by the original sequence of numbers in the output grid. The zeros are essentially removed and the original pattern is restored.


Q3: Identify the rule for changing the 0s in the input grid.
A3: A3: The rule for changing the 0s in the input grid is to replace them with the original sequence of numbers that was interrupted by the 0s. The sequence is determined by the pattern in the row before the 0s appear.


Q4: Apply the identified rule to the 0s in the quiz input grid to generate the output grid.
A4: A4: Applying the identified rule to the 0s in the quiz input grid, the output grid would be:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

- The cell at (24,5) surrounded by color 0
- The cell at (25,10) surrounded by color 0

Q2: What is the rule for changing the color of these cells?

The rule for changing the color of these cells is that they take on the color of the cell that is diagonally adjacent to them. If there are multiple diagonally adjacent cells with different colors, they take on the color of the cell that is diagonally adjacent to them in the top-left direction. If there is no cell in the top-left direction, they take on the color of the cell that is diagonally adjacent to them in the top-right direction. If there is no cell in the top-right direction, they take on the color of the cell that is diagonally adjacent to them in the bottom-left direction. If there is no cell in the bottom-left direction, they take on the color of the cell that is diagonally adjacent to them in the bottom-right direction.

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples is as follows:

1. The original input grid is copied to the left half of the output grid.
2. The right half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the left half, but with the colors of the cells inverted. The color inversion is done in such a way that the color of the cell in the center of the input grid is replaced with the color of the cell in the corners of the input grid, and vice versa.
3. The bottom half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the top half, but with the colors of the cells inverted. The color inversion is done in such a way that the color of the cell in the center of the input grid is replaced with the color of the cell in the corners of the input grid, and vice versa.

In other words, the transformation involves mirroring and color inversion.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a 10x10 grid, which is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 10x10 grid, which is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions. This is because the transformation involves copying the input grid to the left half of the output grid and then creating a mirrored version of it on the right half. The same process is then repeated vertically to fill the bottom half of the output grid.

Quiz Answer:
If the input grid is 
[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]],
then the output grid would be
[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].


Q3: Observe that the first half of the output grid is a copy of the input grid, but with the center value replaced with the value in the center of the input grid's border.
A3: A3: Yes, that's correct. The first half of the output grid is indeed a copy of the input grid, but with the center value replaced with the value in the center of the input grid's border. This is part of the transformation pattern identified earlier. The same pattern is then mirrored on the right half of the output grid, but with the colors inverted.


Q4: Notice that the second half of the output grid is a 5x5 grid that starts with the center value of the input grid's border and then decreases by 1 in each subsequent row, until it reaches the value in the center of the input grid.
A4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The second half of the output grid is indeed a 5x5 grid that starts with the center value of the input grid's border and then decreases by 1 in each subsequent row, until it reaches the value in the center of the input grid. This is part of the transformation pattern identified earlier. The same pattern is then mirrored on the bottom half of the output grid, but with the colors inverted.


Q5: Apply these observations to the quiz input grid to generate the output grid.
A5: A5: Applying these observations to the quiz input grid, we get the following output grid:

[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].

This output grid is generated by first copying the input grid to the left half of the output grid, then creating a mirrored version of it on the right half with the colors inverted. The same process is then repeated vertically to fill the bottom half of the output grid.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples is as follows:

1. The grid is divided into two halves vertically by the column containing the number 2. 

2. For each half, the presence of the number 7 in a cell is replaced by the number 1, and the absence of the number 7 (represented by the number 0) is still represented by the number 0. 

3. The column containing the number 2 is not included in the output grid. 

4. The output grid is a 5x6 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid. 

So, the transformation involves a kind of binary conversion where the presence of the number 7 is represented by 1 and its absence by 0, and the column with the number 2 is removed.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is always smaller than the input grid.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always smaller than the input grid. This is because the column containing the number 2 in the input grid is not included in the output grid. The output grid is always a 5x6 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid.


Q3: Identify the role of the number 2 in the input grid.
A3: A3: The number 2 in the input grid serves as a divider or separator between the two halves of the grid. It is always located in the middle column of the input grid. The column containing the number 2 is not included in the output grid.


Q4: Determine the rule for transforming the left part of the input grid (before the number 2) into the left part of the output grid.
A4: A4: The rule for transforming the left part of the input grid (before the number 2) into the left part of the output grid is as follows:

1. For each cell in the left part of the input grid, if the cell contains the number 7, it is replaced by the number 1 in the output grid.

2. If the cell does not contain the number 7 (i.e., it contains the number 0), it remains as 0 in the output grid.

This rule applies to each row in the left part of the input grid, resulting in the left part of the output grid.


Q5: Determine the rule for transforming the right part of the input grid (after the number 2) into the right part of the output grid.
A5: The rule for transforming the right part of the input grid (after the number 2) into the right part of the output grid is the same as the rule for the left part:

1. For each cell in the right part of the input grid, if the cell contains the number 7, it is replaced by the number 1 in the output grid.

2. If the cell does not contain the number 7 (i.e., it contains the number 0), it remains as 0 in the output grid.

This rule applies to each row in the right part of the input grid, resulting in the right part of the output grid.


Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is 
[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]],
then the output grid is 
[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]].


Q5: Determine the rule for transforming the right part of the input grid (after the number 2) into the right part of the output grid.
A5: A5: The rule for transforming the right part of the input grid (after the number 2) into the right part of the output grid is the same as the rule for the left part:

1. For each cell in the right part of the input grid, if the cell contains the number 7, it is replaced by the number 1 in the output grid.

2. If the cell does not contain the number 7 (i.e., it contains the number 0), it remains as 0 in the output grid.

This rule applies to each row in the right part of the input grid, resulting in the right part of the output grid.


Q6: Combine the results from Q4 and Q5 to generate the complete output grid.
A6: A6: To generate the complete output grid, we combine the transformed left and right parts of the input grid. 

1. We start by applying the transformation rule to the left part of the input grid (before the number 2), replacing each occurrence of the number 7 with the number 1 and leaving the number 0 as it is. 

2. We then apply the same transformation rule to the right part of the input grid (after the number 2), again replacing each occurrence of the number 7 with the number 1 and leaving the number 0 as it is. 

3. Finally, we combine the transformed left and right parts to form the complete output grid. 

For example, if the input grid is 
[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]],
the output grid is 
[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]].

","A6: To generate the complete output grid, we combine the transformed left and right parts of the input grid. 

1. We start by applying the transformation rule to the left part of the input grid (before the number 2), replacing each occurrence of the number 7 with the number 1 and leaving the number 0 as it is.

Q1: Identify the pattern of the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern of transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples seems to be as follows:

1. The input grid is divided into two halves horizontally. The top half contains the number 9 and the bottom half contains the number 4.

2. The output grid is a 3x5 grid where the number 9 in the input grid is replaced by the number 6.

3. The position of the number 6 in the output grid corresponds to the position of the number 9 in the input grid. However, the positions are mirrored along the vertical center line of the grid. 

4. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is always a 3x5 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid.
A2: A2: Yes, that's correct. The output grid is always a 3x5 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid. This is part of the transformation pattern. The input grid is always reduced to a 3x5 grid in the output, with the positions of the number 9 from the input grid mirrored along the vertical center line and replaced with the number 6. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s.

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is 
[[9, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]],
then the output grid would be 
[[0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0]].


Q3: Observe the transformation of the number 9 in the input grid.
A3: A3: Yes, the transformation of the number 9 in the input grid is quite interesting. It seems to be replaced by the number 6 in the output grid. Moreover, its position is mirrored along the vertical center line of the grid. This means that if a 9 is on the left side of the input grid, it will appear on the right side of the output grid, and vice versa.


Q4: Observe the transformation of the number 4 in the input grid.
A4: A4: The number 4 in the input grid does not appear in the output grid. It seems to be ignored in the transformation process. The output grid only reflects the positions of the number 9 from the input grid, replaced with the number 6 and mirrored along the vertical center line. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s, regardless of whether they were 4s or 0s in the input grid.


Q5: Observe the transformation of the number 0 in the input grid.
A5: A5: The number 0 in the input grid seems to be the default value in the output grid. In the output grid, all cells that do not contain the transformed number 6 (which was 9 in the input grid) are filled with 0s. This is regardless of whether these cells contained 0s, 4s, or 9s in the input grid. The only exception is when a 9 from the input grid is transformed into a 6 in the output grid.


Q6: Apply the rules found in Q2 to Q5 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A6: A6: Applying the rules found in Q2 to Q5 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

If the input grid is 
[[9, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]],

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

A1: The cells that are surrounded by 8s in the input grid are the ones that have 8s in all four directions (up, down, left, and right). 

In the given input grid, these cells are:

- (2, 5) with value 4
- (2, 6) with value 4
- (2, 7) with value 4
- (2, 8) with value 4
- (2, 9) with value 4
- (3, 5) with value 4
- (3, 6) with value 4
- (3, 7) with value 4
- (3, 8) with value 4
- (3, 9) with value 4
- (4, 5) with value 4
- (4, 6) with value 4
- (4, 7) with value 4
- (4, 8) with value 4
- (4, 9) with value 4
- (5, 5) with value 4
- (5, 6) with value 4
- (5, 7) with value 4
- (5, 8) with value 4
- (5, 9) with value 4
- (6, 5) with value 4
- (6, 6) with value 4
- (6, 7) with value 4
- (6, 8) with value 4
- (6, 9) with value 4

The pattern seems to be that these cells are replaced with the number 4 in the output grid.


Q2: Change the identified cells to 4s in the output grid.
A2: A2: The output grid after changing the identified cells to 4s would be:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

- The rectangle from (9,2) to (9,7) and from (12,2) to (12,7)
- The rectangle from (11,10) to (11,16) and from (13,10) to (13,16)


Q2: Determine the shape of each identified area from Q1.
A2: A2: The shapes of each identified area from Q1 are as follows:

- The rectangles from (1,2) to (1,5) and from (3,2) to (3,5) are both 1x4 rectangles.
- The rectangles from (1,13) to (1,16) and from (3,13) to (3,16) are both 1x4 rectangles.
- The rectangles from (6,12) to (6,16) and from (8,12) to (8,16) are both 1x5 rectangles.
- The rectangle from (9,2) to (12,7) is a 4x6 rectangle.
- The rectangle from (11,10) to (13,16) is a 3x7 rectangle.


Q3: If the shape is a square or rectangle, change the 8s to 1s.
A3: A3: All the shapes identified in Q2 are rectangles. Therefore, we change all the 8s in these areas to 1s. The output grid will be as follows:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Q2: Identify the columns that contain the number 7.
A2: A2: The columns that contain the number 7 are columns 5 to 11.


Q3: Identify the pattern of the number 7 in the rows and columns.
A3: A3: The pattern of the number 7 in the rows and columns is that it forms a rectangle shape. The rectangle is hollow in the middle, with the number 7 forming the border of the rectangle. The rectangle starts from the 5th column to the 11th column and from the 2nd row to the 14th row. The number 7 is also present in the 5th, 8th, and 11th columns within the rectangle.


Q4: Apply the pattern to the input grid by shifting the number 7 to the left or right based on the pattern.
A4: A4: The pattern seems to be that the number 7 is shifted towards the center of the rectangle. So, applying this pattern to the input grid, the output grid would be:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid is as follows:

1. The size of the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions. If the input grid is of size m x n, the output grid is of size 3m x 3n.

2. Each cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid. For example, if a cell in the input grid at position (i, j) has a value of v, then the cells in the output grid at positions (3i, 3j), (3i+1, 3j+1), and (3i+2, 3j+2) will have a value of v.

3. For the cells in the output grid that do not correspond to a cell in the input grid, their value is determined by the following rule: if the cell is in an even row and an even column, its value is 2; otherwise, its value is 0. The rows and columns are 0-indexed, meaning the first row and the first column are considered row 0 and column 0, respectively.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is three times the size of the input grid in both dimensions. This means that if the input grid is of size m x n, the output grid will be of size 3m x 3n. This is a consistent pattern observed in all the examples provided.


Q3: Observe that every cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid.
A3: A3: Yes, that's correct. Each cell in the input grid is replicated three times in both dimensions in the output grid. For example, if a cell in the input grid at position (i, j) has a value of v, then the cells in the output grid at positions (3i, 3j), (3i+1, 3j+1), and (3i+2, 3j+2) will have a value of v. This is a consistent pattern observed in all the examples provided.

Q4: What is the rule for the cells in the output grid that do not correspond to a cell in the input grid?
A4: The rule for the cells in the output grid that do not correspond to a cell in the input grid is as follows: if the cell is in an even row and an even column, its value is 2; otherwise, its value is 0. The rows and columns are 0-indexed, meaning the first row and the first column are considered row 0 and column 0, respectively.

Q5: What is the output grid for the quiz input?
A5: The output grid for the quiz input is as follows:

[[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], 
 [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], 
 [4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]]


Q4: Notice that the first cell of every three cells in the output grid, both in rows and columns, is replaced by 2 if it was 0 in the input grid.
A4: A4: Yes, that's correct. In the output grid, the first cell of every three cells, both in rows and columns, is replaced by 2 if it was 0 in the input grid. This is a consistent pattern observed in all the examples provided. This pattern is part of the rule for determining the value of cells in the output grid that do not correspond to a cell in the input grid. Specifically, if the cell is in an even row and an even column, its value is 2; otherwise, its value is 0.


Q5: Apply these transformations to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A5: A5: Applying the transformations to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

[[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the size of the input grid.
A1: The size of the input grid is 3x3.


Q2: Create a new grid that is three times the size of the input grid.
A2: A2: The new grid would be 9x9.


Q3: Copy the input grid into the top left, top right, and bottom center of the new grid.
A3: A3: The new grid would look like this:

[[9, 7, 9, 9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0], 
 [9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0],

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,

then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Quiz
If input grids are like that
[[0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5]],
then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the position of the number 5 in the input grid.
A1: A1: The number 5 is located at the positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) and (3,2) in the input grid.


Q2: For each position of 5, create a 2x2 grid with the pattern [[1,2],[2,1]].
A2: A2: For each position of 5, the 2x2 grid with the pattern [[1,2],[2,1]] is created as follows:

For position (2,1):
[[1,2],
 [2,1]]

For position (2,2):
[[1,2],
 [2,1]]

For position (2,3):
[[1,2],
 [2,1]]

For position (3,2):
[[1,2],
 [2,1]]

Q3: Replace the position of 5 in the input grid with the 2x2 grid.
A3: Replacing the position of 5 in the input grid with the 2x2 grid, we get the following output grid:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1],
 [0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
 [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]]


Q3: Combine these 2x2 grids in the same position as the 5 in the input grid to form the output grid.
A3: A3: Combining these 2x2 grids in the same position as the 5 in the input grid, we get the following output grid:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1],
 [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]]


Q4: If there is no 5 in the position, fill the corresponding position in the output grid with 0.
A4: A4: If there is no 5 in the position, the corresponding position in the output grid is filled with 0. Therefore, the final output grid is:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1],
 [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]]

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Q1: Identify the pattern in the input grids of the examples.
A1: The pattern in the input grids of the examples is that there are groups of numbers (representing colors) that form a specific shape or pattern. These groups are surrounded by zeros. The groups of numbers are symmetrical and usually form a square or rectangle shape. The numbers within these groups are arranged in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the numbers 8, 4, and 8 form a vertical line in the middle of the group, and the numbers 4 and 8 form a horizontal line at the top and bottom of the group. Similarly, in Example 2, the numbers 5, 8, and 5 form a vertical line in the middle of the group, and the number 8 forms a horizontal line in the middle of the group.


Q2: Identify the numbers that are swapped in the input grid of the quiz.
A2: A2: In the quiz input grid, the numbers that are swapped are 2 and 3 in the first group, and 1 and 6 in the second group.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

- Row 14, Column 13

Note: The row and column numbers start from 0.


Q2: Determine the pattern of the number 2 in the input grid.
A2: A2: The pattern of the number 2 in the input grid seems to form three separate shapes. The first shape is a square located at the top left of the grid. The second shape is a square located at the middle right of the grid. The third shape is a vertical line located at the bottom left of the grid. Each shape is separated by rows and columns of zeros. 

Q3: Apply the pattern to the output grid.
A3: The output grid should be a smaller grid that only contains the shapes formed by the number 2 in the input grid. The shapes should be in the same relative positions to each other, but without the rows and columns of zeros in between. The output grid should be as follows:

[[2, 0, 2], 
 [0, 2, 0], 
 [2, 2, 2], 
 [0, 0, 0], 
 [2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 0, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2]]


Q3: Identify the smallest rectangle that can contain the pattern of the number 2.
A3: A3: The smallest rectangle that can contain the pattern of the number 2 is a rectangle with the top left corner at (2, 6), the top right corner at (5, 14), the bottom left corner at (14, 2), and the bottom right corner at (14, 13). This rectangle has a height of 13 rows and a width of 9 columns.


Q4: Crop the input grid based on the rectangle identified in Q3.
A4: A4: The cropped input grid based on the rectangle identified in Q3 is as follows:

[[0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], 
 [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], 
 [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], 
 [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], 
 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]]


Q5: Identify the pattern of the number 2 in the cropped grid.
A5: A5: The pattern of the number 2 in the cropped grid is as follows:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the different regions in the grid, where a region is a group of the same number connected vertically or horizontally.
A1: A1: The different regions in the grid are as follows:

- Region of 1s: This is the largest region and it surrounds all other regions.
- Region of 2s: This region is located in the middle of the grid and is surrounded by the region of 1s.
- Region of 3s: This region is located within the region of 2s.
- Region of 8s: This region is located within the region of 1s, below the region of 3s.
- Region of 6s: This region is located within the region of 1s, at the bottom of the grid.


Q2: Determine the size of each region.
A2: A2: The size of each region is as follows:

- Region of 1s: This region covers the majority of the grid, with a size of 256 - 40 - 16 - 6 - 2 = 192 cells.
- Region of 2s: This region is 5 cells high and 8 cells wide, so it has a size of 40 cells.
- Region of 3s: This region is 4 cells high and 4 cells wide, so it has a size of 16 cells.
- Region of 8s: This region is 3 cells high and 2 cells wide, so it has a size of 6 cells.
- Region of 6s: This region is 2 cells high and 1 cell wide, so it has a size of 2 cells.


Q3: Identify the regions that are surrounded by '1's.
A3: A3: The regions that are surrounded by '1's are the regions of '2's, '3's, '8's, and '6's.


Q4: For each region identified in Q3, if the size of the region is greater than 4, keep the region as it is.
A4: A4: The regions that have a size greater than 4 are the regions of '2's and '3's. Therefore, these regions are kept as they are. The regions of '8's and '6's have a size less than 4, so they are not kept. 

Q5: For each region identified in Q3, if the size of the region is less than or equal to 4, replace the region with '1's.
A5: The regions of '8's and '6's have a size less than or equal to 4, so they are replaced with '1's. 

Q6: After applying the rules in Q4 and Q5, what is the resulting grid?
A6: The resulting grid is as follows:

[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
