Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the different regions in the grid, where a region is a group of cells with the same color that are connected through their edges.
A1: A1: The different regions in the grid are as follows:

- Region 1: Cells with color 1, which is the majority of the grid.
- Region 2: Cells with color 2, which form a rectangle in the middle of the grid.
- Region 3: Cells with color 3, which form a smaller rectangle inside the rectangle of color 2.
- Region 4: Cells with color 8, which form a small rectangle at the bottom of the grid.
- Region 5: Cells with color 6, which form a small rectangle at the bottom left of the grid.


Q2: Determine the order of the regions from top to bottom and left to right.
A2: A2: The order of the regions from top to bottom and left to right is as follows:

- Region 1: Cells with color 1, which is the majority of the grid.
- Region 2: Cells with color 2, which form a rectangle in the middle of the grid.
- Region 3: Cells with color 3, which form a smaller rectangle inside the rectangle of color 2.
- Region 4: Cells with color 8, which form a small rectangle at the bottom of the grid.
- Region 5: Cells with color 6, which form a small rectangle at the bottom left of the grid.


Q3: For each region, determine the number of cells it contains.
A3: A3: The number of cells each region contains is as follows:

- Region 1: 192 cells with color 1.
- Region 2: 40 cells with color 2.
- Region 3: 8 cells with color 3.
- Region 4: 6 cells with color 8.
- Region 5: 2 cells with color 6.


Q4: Create a new grid with the number of rows equal to the number of regions and the number of columns equal to the maximum number of cells in a region.
A4: A4: The new grid would have 5 rows (for the 5 regions) and 192 columns (for the maximum number of cells in a region, which is region 1 with 192 cells). The grid would look like this:

[[1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1],  # 192 times
 [2, 2, 2, ..., 2, 2, 2],  # 40 times
 [3, 3, 3, ..., 3, 3, 3],  # 8 times
 [8, 8, 8, ..., 8, 8, 8],  # 6 times
 [6, 6, 6, ..., 6, 6, 6]]  # 2 times

Note: The dots (...) represent continuation of the pattern. For example, [1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1] means a row of 192 cells all with color 1.


Q5: Fill the new grid with the color of each region, where each row corresponds to a region and the number of cells filled with the region's color is equal to the number of cells in that region in the input grid.
A5: A5: The new grid would look like this:

[[1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1],  # 192 times
 [2, 2, 2, ..., 2, 2, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0],  # 40 times 2, then 152 times 0
 [3, 3, 3, ..., 3, 3, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0],  # 8 times 3, then 184 times 0
 [8, 8, 8, ..., 8, 8, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0],  # 6 times 8, then 186 times 0
 [6, 6, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0]]  # 2 times 6, then 190 times 0

Note: The dots (...) represent continuation of the pattern. For example, [1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, 1] means a row of 192 cells all with color 1. The 0s represent empty cells.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the input grid.
A1: The pattern in the input grid is that there are certain objects (represented by numbers other than 0) that are located in specific positions. These objects are then moved down by the same number of rows as they are positioned from the top. The objects maintain their relative positions to each other during the move.


Q2: Identify the position of the pattern in the input grid.
A2: A2: The pattern in the input grid is located in the middle of the grid. The objects (numbers other than 0) are located in specific rows and columns. For example, in the quiz input grid, the objects are located in the 3rd, 9th, 10th, and 11th rows.


Q3: Identify the transformation applied to the pattern in the examples.
A3: A3: The transformation applied to the pattern in the examples is a downward shift. The objects (numbers other than 0) are moved down by the same number of rows as they are positioned from the top. The objects maintain their relative positions to each other during the move.


Q4: Apply the same transformation to the pattern in the quiz input grid.
A4: A4: Applying the same transformation to the pattern in the quiz input grid, the output grid would be:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 1, 0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]]


Q5: Replace the original pattern in the input grid with the transformed pattern to generate the output grid.
A5: A5: Replacing the original pattern in the input grid with the transformed pattern, the output grid would be:

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of 1s in the input grid.
A1: A1: The pattern of 1s in the input grid forms a triangle shape. The triangle is located at the top left corner of the grid. The base of the triangle is along the left edge of the grid and the height of the triangle is along the top edge of the grid. The triangle is made up of 1s and the rest of the grid is filled with 0s.


Q2: Identify the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the input grid.
A2: A2: The pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 in the input grid is that they are located in a single row towards the bottom of the grid. They are evenly spaced apart with 0s in between and on either side. The order from left to right is 2, 8, 3, 6.


Q3: Map the pattern of 1s to the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8.
A3: A3: The pattern of 1s is mapped to the pattern of 2, 3, 6, and 8 by replacing each row of 1s with a row of 2s, 8s, 3s, and 6s. The number of 1s in each row determines the number of 2s, 8s, 3s, and 6s in the corresponding row. The pattern of 1s is mirrored along the vertical axis and then each 1 is replaced with a 2, 8, 3, or 6 in the order they appear in the input grid. The output grid is smaller than the input grid and only contains the rows and columns where the 1s and 2, 8, 3, 6 were located.

So, the output grids are like that
[[0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0], [2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0], [2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0]].


Q4: Generate the output grid based on the mapping from Q3.
A4: A4: Based on the mapping from Q3, the output grid is generated by replacing each row of 1s with a row of 2s, 8s, 3s, and 6s. The number of 1s in each row determines the number of 2s, 8s, 3s, and 6s in the corresponding row. The pattern of 1s is mirrored along the vertical axis and then each 1 is replaced with a 2, 8, 3, or 6 in the order they appear in the input grid. The output grid is smaller than the input grid and only contains the rows and columns where the 1s and 2, 8, 3, 6 were located. So, the output grid is as follows:

[[0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0], 
 [2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0], 
 [2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0, 0], 
 [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 6, 6, 0]]

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of the number 1 in the input grid.
A1: The pattern of the number 1 in the input grid forms a shape similar to a plus sign (+) or a cross. The cross is repeated twice in the grid, once in the upper left corner and once in the lower right corner. The cross consists of a vertical and a horizontal line of 1s intersecting at a central point. The central point of the cross is a square of 1s. The arms of the cross are made up of 1s with a single 0 in the middle.


Q2: Determine the size of the output grid based on the pattern identified in Q1.
A2: A2: The output grid is a 5x5 grid. This is because the pattern identified in the input grid is a 5x5 cross of 1s. The output grid is a smaller representation of this cross.


Q3: Identify the positions of the number 1 in the output grid based on the pattern identified in Q1.
A3: A3: The positions of the number 1 in the output grid form a cross shape similar to the pattern identified in the input grid. The cross consists of a vertical and a horizontal line of 1s intersecting at a central point. The central point of the cross is a square of 1s. The arms of the cross are made up of 1s with a single 0 in the middle.


Q4: Fill in the number 1 in the positions identified in Q3 in the output grid.
A4: A4: The output grid filled with the number 1 in the positions identified in Q3 is as follows:

[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Q1: Identify the cells that are surrounded by the same color on the top, bottom, and either the left or right side.
A1: The cells that are surrounded by the same color on the top, bottom, and either the left or right side are:

- The cell at (3, 10) surrounded by color 8
- The cell at (4, 16) surrounded by color 3
- The cell at (9, 10) surrounded by color 8
- The cell at (10, 16) surrounded by color 3
- The cell at (15, 10) surrounded by color 8
- The cell at (16, 16) surrounded by color 2
- The cell at (21, 10) surrounded by color 8
- The cell at (22, 16) surrounded by color 2

These cells are identified by their row and column indices, starting from the top left corner of the grid (0, 0).

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of 4s in the input grid.
A1: A1: The pattern of 4s in the input grid forms a diamond shape. The diamond is symmetrical both vertically and horizontally. The diamond is formed by 4s and the rest of the grid is filled with 0s.


Q2: Determine the transformation rule from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A2: A2: The transformation rule appears to be a reflection of the input grid both vertically and horizontally, with the original grid placed in the center. The diamond shape of 4s in the input grid is reflected to the top, bottom, left, and right in the output grid, creating a larger diamond shape. The rest of the grid is filled with 0s.


Q3: Apply the transformation rule to the pattern of 4s in the input grid of the quiz.
A3: A3: The transformation rule applied to the pattern of 4s in the input grid of the quiz would result in a larger diamond shape of 4s in the output grid. The original diamond shape in the input grid would be reflected to the top, bottom, left, and right in the output grid. The rest of the grid would be filled with 0s.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

1. The first shape is a square located at the top left corner of the grid. It is a 3x3 square with the center cell empty.

2. The second shape is a larger square located at the top right corner of the grid. It is a 4x4 square with the center 2x2 cells empty.

3. The third shape is a vertical line located at the center of the grid. It is a 1x6 line.

4. The fourth shape is a cross located at the bottom right corner of the grid. It is a 5x5 cross with the corners empty.


Q2: Determine the color each shape should be transformed into based on the examples.
A2: A2: Based on the examples, each shape should be transformed into a different color. The color transformation is as follows:

1. The first shape (3x3 square) should be transformed into color 1.
2. The second shape (4x4 square) should be transformed into color 2.
3. The third shape (1x6 line) should be transformed into color 3.
4. The fourth shape (5x5 cross) should be transformed into color 4.


Q3: Transform each shape into the corresponding color based on the pattern identified in Q2.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the input grids.
A1: The pattern in the input grids is that the center 4x4 grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The rest of the grid remains the same.


Q2: Notice that the output grids are always 4x7.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grids are always 4x7. This is because the center 4x4 grid of the input is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then placed in the center of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the remaining elements from the input grid.


Q3: Notice that the output grids are always located in the center of the input grids.
A3: A3: Yes, the output grids are always located in the center of the input grids. This is because the center 4x4 grid of the input is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then placed in the center of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the remaining elements from the input grid.


Q4: Identify the exact location of the output grids in the input grids.
A4: A4: The output grids are derived from the center 4x4 grid of the input grids. Specifically, the output grids are formed by rotating the 4x4 grid located in the 14th to 17th rows and 14th to 17th columns of the input grids 90 degrees clockwise.


Q5: Extract the output grids from the input grids.
A5: A5: To extract the output grids from the input grids, you would need to identify the center 4x4 grid in the input, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, and then place it in the center of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the remaining elements from the input grid. 

For example, in the given quiz input, the center 4x4 grid is:

[[9, 7, 7, 4],
 [7, 4, 9, 7],
 [7, 9, 4, 7],
 [9, 7, 7, 4]]

Rotating this 90 degrees clockwise gives:

[[9, 7, 7, 9],
 [7, 9, 4, 7],
 [7, 4, 9, 7],
 [4, 7, 7, 4]]

This rotated grid is then placed in the center of the output grid, and the remaining elements from the input grid are used to fill in the rest of the output grid.

","A5: To extract the output grids from the input grids, you would need to identify the center 4x4 grid in the input, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, and then place it in the center of the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with the remaining elements from the input grid. 

For example, in the given quiz input, the center 4x4 grid is:

[[9, 7, 7, 4],
 [7, 4, 9, 7],
 [7, 9, 4, 7],
 [9, 7, 7, 4]]

Rotating this 90 degrees clockwise gives:

[[9, 7, 7, 9],
 [7, 9, 4, 7],
 [7, 4, 9, 7],
 [4, 7, 7, 4]]

This rotated grid is then placed in the center of the output grid, and the remaining elements from the input grid are used to fill in the rest of the output grid.","[[9, 7, 7, 4], [7, 4, 9, 7], [7, 9, 4, 7], [9, 7, 7, 4]]Rotating this 90 degrees clockwise gives:[[9, 7, 7, 9], [7, 9, 4, 7], [7, 4, 9, 7], [4, 7, 7, 4]]","[[7, 7, 9], [7, 2, 9], [7, 2, 9], [7, 7, 9], [4, 4, 7], [4, 4, 7], [6, 6, 1], [6, 6, 6], [1, 6, 1]]","[[9, 7, 7, 9], [7, 9, 4, 7], [7, 4, 9, 7], [4, 7, 7, 4]]",False,,Tedious

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Please note that the row and column numbers start from 1, not 0.


Q3: Determine the area between the locations of the number 8 and the number 2.
A3: A3: The area between the locations of the number 8 and the number 2 can be determined by finding the minimum and maximum row and column numbers of the locations of the number 8 and the number 2. 

The minimum row number is 4, the maximum row number is 21, the minimum column number is 2, and the maximum column number is 21. 

Therefore, the area between the locations of the number 8 and the number 2 is a rectangle with the top left corner at (4, 2) and the bottom right corner at (21, 21). 

This rectangle includes all the cells in rows 4 to 21 and columns 2 to 21.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========

Example 1

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Q2: For each row identified in Q1, check if there are any 1s in the row.
A2: A2: There are no 1s in the rows identified in Q1. The rows that contain the number 2 only have 2s and 0s.


Q3: If there are 1s in the row, identify the position of the 1s.
A3: A3: As stated in A2, there are no 1s in the rows that contain the number 2. Therefore, there are no positions of 1s to identify in these rows.


Q4: Check if the 1s are adjacent to each other.
A4: A4: As stated in A2 and A3, there are no 1s in the rows that contain the number 2. Therefore, there are no adjacent 1s to check in these rows.


Q5: If the 1s are adjacent, keep them as they are.
A5: A5: As stated in A2, A3, and A4, there are no 1s in the rows that contain the number 2. Therefore, there are no adjacent 1s to keep as they are. 

Q6: If the 1s are not adjacent, move the 1s so that they are adjacent to each other.
A6: In the rows that do not contain the number 2, if the 1s are not adjacent, they are moved so that they are adjacent to each other. This is done by shifting the 1s towards the center of the row.

Q7: Apply the rules identified in Q5 and Q6 to the input grid to get the output grid.
A7: Applying the rules identified in Q5 and Q6 to the input grid, the output grid is as follows:

Q6: Repeat the process for all rows identified in Q1.
A6: A6: The process is repeated for all rows identified in Q1. As stated in A2, A3, A4, and A5, there are no 1s in the rows that contain the number 2. Therefore, there are no changes made to these rows. The changes are made to the rows that do not contain the number 2, where the 1s are moved to be adjacent to each other if they are not already.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of numbers in the input grid.
A1: The pattern in the input grid is as follows:

1. The first two rows and the first two columns are filled with 1s.
2. The third row and the third column are filled with 4s.
3. Starting from the fourth row and the fourth column, the numbers are arranged in a repeating sequence of 3, 2, 1, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.
4. There are some 0s in the grid, which seem to be placed in a specific pattern. The 0s start appearing from the 12th column and continue till the 18th column. The number of 0s in each row increases by one as we move down the rows, starting from the 7th row. The 0s stop appearing after the 19th row.


Q2: Identify the areas in the grid where the pattern is interrupted by zeros.
A2: A2: The pattern is interrupted by zeros in the following areas:

1. From the 7th to the 19th row, the pattern is interrupted in the 12th to 18th columns.
2. In the 8th row, the pattern is interrupted in the 2nd column.
3. From the 10th to the 14th row, the pattern is interrupted in the 1st column.
4. From the 15th to the 19th row, the pattern is interrupted in the 2nd column.
5. From the 20th to the 24th row, the pattern is interrupted in the 8th to 14th columns.


Q3: Determine the pattern of numbers that should replace the zeros.
A3: A3: The pattern of numbers that should replace the zeros is the same as the pattern in the rest of the grid. The numbers should continue the sequence of 3, 2, 1, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The sequence should continue from the last number before the zeros and resume after the zeros.


Q4: Replace the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers.
A4: A4: If we replace the zeros with the correct pattern of numbers, the output grid will be as follows:

[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

A2: A2: 

- For 0: All the cells that do not contain any other number are connected to each other.
- For 1: There are several groups of connected cells. One large group is in the bottom right corner, another group is in the middle of the grid, and there are several smaller groups scattered throughout the grid.
- For 3: There is only one cell with the number 3, so it is not connected to any other cells.
- For 4: There is only one cell with the number 4, so it is not connected to any other cells.
- For 5: There is only one cell with the number 5, so it is not connected to any other cells.
- For 6: There is only one cell with the number 6, so it is not connected to any other cells.
- For 7: There is only one cell with the number 7, so it is not connected to any other cells.
- For 8: There is only one cell with the number 8, so it is not connected to any other cells.


Q3: For each group of connected cells, identify the cells that are on the boundary of the group.
A3: A3: 

- For 0: The boundary cells are the ones that are adjacent to any cell containing a number other than 0.
- For 1: The boundary cells are the ones that are adjacent to any cell containing a number other than 1. This includes the cells on the outer edges of the large group in the bottom right corner and the middle of the grid, as well as the individual cells scattered throughout the grid.
- For 3: Since there is only one cell with the number 3, it is considered a boundary cell.
- For 4: Since there is only one cell with the number 4, it is considered a boundary cell.
- For 5: Since there is only one cell with the number 5, it is considered a boundary cell.
- For 6: Since there is only one cell with the number 6, it is considered a boundary cell.
- For 7: Since there is only one cell with the number 7, it is considered a boundary cell.
- For 8: Since there is only one cell with the number 8, it is considered a boundary cell.


Q4: For each boundary cell, identify the cells that are adjacent to it but not part of the group.
A4: A4: 

- For 0: The adjacent cells that are not part of the group are the ones that contain any number other than 0.
- For 1: The adjacent cells that are not part of the group are the ones that contain any number other than 1. This includes the cells that are next to the large group in the bottom right corner and the middle of the grid, as well as the cells that are next to the individual cells scattered throughout the grid.
- For 3: The adjacent cells that are not part of the group are the ones that contain any number other than 3. In this case, these are the cells that are next to the single cell with the number 3.
- For 4: The adjacent cells that are not part of the group are the ones that contain any number other than 4. In this case, these are the cells that are next to the single cell with the number 4.
- For 5: The adjacent cells that are not part of the group are the ones that contain any number other than 5. In this case, these are the cells that are next to the single cell with the number 5.
- For 6: The adjacent cells that are not part of the group are the ones that contain any number other than 6. In this case, these are the cells that are next to the single cell with the number 6.
- For 7: The adjacent cells that are not part of the group are the ones that contain any number other than 7. In this case, these are the cells that are next to the single cell with the number 7.
- For 8: The adjacent cells that are not part of the group are the ones that contain any number other than 8. In this case, these are the cells that are next to the single cell with the number 8.


Q5: For each group of connected cells, identify the unique numbers of the cells identified in Q4.
A5: A5: 

- For 0: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells that are not part of the group are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

- For 7: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells that are not part of the group are 0, 1.
- For 8: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells that are not part of the group are 0, 1.


Q6: For each group of connected cells, if the unique numbers identified in Q5 are the same as the number of the group, change the cells in the group to that number.
A6: A6: 

- For 0: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group, so the cells in the group are not changed.
- For 1: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group, so the cells in the group are not changed.
- For 3: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group, so the cells in the group are not changed.
- For 4: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group, so the cells in the group are not changed.
- For 5: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group, so the cells in the group are not changed.
- For 6: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group, so the cells in the group are not changed.
- For 7: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group, so the cells in the group are not changed.
- For 8: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group, so the cells in the group are not changed.

Therefore, the output grid is the same as the input grid.


Q7: For each group of connected cells, if the unique numbers identified in Q5 are not the same as the number of the group, change the cells in the group to the number that is most common among the cells identified in Q4.
A7: A7: A7: 

- For 0: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group. The most common number among the adjacent cells is 1, so the cells in the group are changed to 1.
- For 1: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group. The most common number among the adjacent cells is 0, so the cells in the group are changed to 0.
- For 3: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group. The most common number among the adjacent cells is 0, so the cells in the group are changed to 0.
- For 4: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group. The most common number among the adjacent cells is 0, so the cells in the group are changed to 0.
- For 5: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group. The most common number among the adjacent cells is 0, so the cells in the group are changed to 0.
- For 6: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group. The most common number among the adjacent cells is 0, so the cells in the group are changed to 0.
- For 7: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group. The most common number among the adjacent cells is 0, so the cells in the group are changed to 0.
- For 8: The unique numbers of the adjacent cells are not the same as the number of the group. The most common number among the adjacent cells is 0, so the cells in the group are changed to 0.

Therefore, the output grid is as follows:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Quiz
If input grids are like that
[[3, 2], [7, 8]],
then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that each row of the input grid is repeated three times in the output grid. The first two repetitions are identical to the input row, and the third repetition is a mirror image of the input row. This pattern is repeated for each row in the input grid.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a 6x6 grid, three times the size of the input grid.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a 6x6 grid, which is three times the size of the input grid. This is because each row of the input grid is repeated three times in the output grid, and each column of the input grid is also repeated three times in the output grid. This results in a 6x6 grid. 

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is [[3, 2], [7, 8]], then the output grid would be [[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]].


Q3: Observe that the first two rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's first row, and the second two rows are repetitions of the input grid's second row.
A3: A3: Yes, that's correct. The first two rows of the output grid are identical to the first row of the input grid, and the third and fourth rows of the output grid are mirror images of the first row of the input grid. Similarly, the fifth and sixth rows of the output grid are identical to the second row of the input grid, and the seventh and eighth rows of the output grid are mirror images of the second row of the input grid. This pattern of repetition and mirroring is consistent across all examples.


Q4: Notice that the third and fourth rows of the output grid are repetitions of the input grid's rows but with the elements in each row swapped.
A4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The third and fourth rows of the output grid are indeed repetitions of the input grid's rows, but with the elements in each row swapped. This creates a mirror image effect. Similarly, the seventh and eighth rows of the output grid are mirror images of the second row of the input grid. This pattern of repetition and mirroring is consistent across all examples.


Q5: Apply the same pattern to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A5: A5: Applying the same pattern to the input grid of the quiz, which is [[3, 2], [7, 8]], we get the output grid as [[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], [8, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]].

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples is as follows:

1. The size of the grid changes from a 3x3 to a 9x9.
2. Each row in the input grid is repeated three times in the output grid.
3. Each value in the row of the input grid is repeated three times in the corresponding rows in the output grid.
4. After the first three rows in the output grid, the rest of the rows are filled with zeros.


Q2: Notice that the input grid is repeated three times horizontally in the output grid.
A2: A2: Yes, that's correct. Each row in the input grid is repeated three times horizontally in the output grid. This means that each value in the row of the input grid is also repeated three times in the corresponding rows in the output grid.

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is [[6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3]], then the output grid would be:
[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].


Q3: Observe that the repeated grids are separated by rows of zeros in the output grid.
A3: A3: Yes, that's correct. After the first three rows in the output grid, which are repetitions of the input grid, the rest of the rows are filled with zeros. This pattern of repeating the input grid followed by rows of zeros is consistent across all the examples.


Q4: Determine the number of rows in the input grid and create that many copies of the input grid horizontally in the output grid.
A4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The number of rows in the input grid determines the number of times the input grid is repeated horizontally in the output grid. For example, if the input grid has 3 rows, then the input grid is repeated 3 times horizontally in the output grid. This pattern is consistent across all the examples.


Q5: Insert rows of zeros in between the repeated grids and at the top and bottom of the output grid.
A5: A5: Yes, that's correct. After the first three rows in the output grid, which are repetitions of the input grid, the rest of the rows are filled with zeros. This pattern of repeating the input grid followed by rows of zeros is consistent across all the examples. The number of zero-filled rows is equal to the number of rows in the input grid.


Q6: Apply these transformations to the input grid in the quiz to generate the output grid.
A6: A6: Yes, that's correct. If we apply these transformations to the input grid in the quiz, we can generate the output grid. The input grid is [[6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3]]. So, we repeat each row in the input grid three times horizontally in the output grid, and then fill the rest of the rows with zeros. The output grid would be:

[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].

Q1: Identify the pattern of the input grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the input grid seems to be that there are certain rows that contain a sequence of the same non-zero numbers (which we can call an ""object"") surrounded by zeros. These objects can be of different lengths and can be located at different positions within the row. The objects can also be of different colors, represented by different numbers.


Q2: Identify the rows in the input grid of the quiz that contain the number 5.
A2: A2: The rows in the input grid of the quiz that contain the number 5 are the first, second, and third rows.


Q3: Identify the pattern of numbers that follow the number 5 in the rows identified in Q2.
A3: A3: The pattern of numbers that follow the number 5 in the rows identified in Q2 are as follows: 
- In the first row, the number 5 is followed by 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0.
- In the second row, the number 5 is followed by 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0.
- In the third row, the number 5 is followed by 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0.


Q4: Identify the empty spaces in the input grid of the quiz that follow the pattern identified in Q3.
A4: A4: The empty spaces in the input grid of the quiz that follow the pattern identified in Q3 are the rows from the fifth to the tenth. These rows are entirely filled with zeros.


Q5: Fill in the empty spaces identified in Q4 with the pattern of numbers identified in Q3.

- The first section before the first occurrence of 5 is replaced with the number 4.
- The second section between the first and last occurrence of 5 is replaced with the number 6.
- The third section after the last occurrence of 5 is replaced with the number 3.

This rule is applied to each row independently.


Q5: Apply the rule determined in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A5: A5: Applying the rule determined in Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we get the output grid as follows:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========
Q1: Identify the positions of the number 1 in the input grid.
A1: A1: The number 1 is located at positions (0,0), (3,3), and (6,6) in the input grid.


Q2: For each position of 1, calculate the position that is three steps to the right and three steps down.
A2: A2: For each position of 1, the position that is three steps to the right and three steps down are (3,3), (6,6), and (9,9) respectively.


Q3: Check if the calculated positions are within the grid boundaries.
A3: A3: Yes, all the calculated positions (3,3), (6,6), and (9,9) are within the grid boundaries.


Q4: If the calculated positions are within the grid boundaries, replace the number at those positions with 2.
A4: A4: Yes, if the calculated positions are within the grid boundaries, we replace the number at those positions with 2. So the output grid will be:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of the number 2 in the input grid.
A1: The pattern of the number 2 in the input grid forms a shape of the number 8. It is formed by 2x2 squares of 2s at the corners and a single line of 2s in the middle. This pattern is repeated in different sections of the grid.


Q2: Identify the pattern of the number 3 in the input grid.
A2: A2: The pattern of the number 3 in the input grid forms a solid block. It is a continuous block of 3s in the middle of the grid.


Q3: Identify the pattern of the number 0 in the input grid.
A3: A3: The pattern of the number 0 in the input grid forms the spaces between the patterns of 2s and 3s. It fills the rest of the grid where there are no 2s or 3s.


Q4: Identify the positions where the number 2 is surrounded by 0s in the input grid.
A4: A4: The number 2 is surrounded by 0s in the input grid at several positions. For example, in the first row, the second and third 2s are surrounded by 0s. Similarly, in the third row, the second and fourth 2s are surrounded by 0s. This pattern repeats in different sections of the grid.


Q5: Replace the number 2 that is surrounded by 0s with the number 8 in the output grid.

If input grids are like that
[[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]],
then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that each row and column of the input grid is duplicated in the output grid. This results in an output grid that is twice as large as the input grid in both dimensions. The values in the cells of the output grid are the same as the corresponding cells in the input grid.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a larger version of the input grid, with each cell in the input grid being represented by a 2x2 square in the output grid.
A2: A2: Yes, that's correct. Each cell in the input grid is represented by a 2x2 square in the output grid. This means that the output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is 
[[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0]],
then the output grid will be
[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].


Q3: Identify the rule for transforming a single cell in the input grid to a 2x2 square in the output grid.
A3: A3: The rule for transforming a single cell in the input grid to a 2x2 square in the output grid is to simply duplicate the value of the cell in the input grid four times. This results in a 2x2 square in the output grid where all four cells have the same value as the original cell in the input grid.


Q4: Apply this rule to each cell in the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A4: A4: Applying the rule to each cell in the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], 
 [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], 
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], 
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].

Each cell in the input grid has been transformed into a 2x2 square in the output grid with the same value.

","A4: Applying the rule to each cell in the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

[[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========

Example 1
If input grids are like that
[[6, 2, 4, 2], [2, 2, 6, 6], [6, 4, 2, 4]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4], [6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6], [2, 4, 2, 6, 6, 2, 4, 2], [2, 4, 2, 6, 6, 2, 4, 2], [6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6], [4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4]].

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is that the input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically. This means that the rows and columns of the input grid are duplicated in reverse order. For example, if the input grid is [[a, b, c, d], [e, f, g, h], [i, j, k, l]], the output grid will be [[d, c, b, a, a, b, c, d], [h, g, f, e, e, f, g, h], [l, k, j, i, i, j, k, l], [l, k, j, i, i, j, k, l], [h, g, f, e, e, f, g, h], [d, c, b, a, a, b, c, d]].


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that the rows and columns of the input grid are duplicated in reverse order to create the output grid.

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is [[8, 5, 7, 8], [7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8, 5]], then the output grid will be [[8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5], [5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8]].


Q3: Implement a function that mirrors the input grid horizontally.
A3: A3: Here is a Python function that mirrors a grid horizontally:

```python
def mirror_grid_horizontally(grid):
    mirrored_grid = []
    for row in grid:
        mirrored_row = row[::-1]  # Reverse the order of elements in the row
        mirrored_grid.append(mirrored_row)
    return mirrored_grid
```

This function takes a 2D list (grid) as input, and for each row in the grid, it reverses the order of elements in the row to create a mirrored row. It then appends this mirrored row to the mirrored grid. The function finally returns the mirrored grid.


Q4: Implement a function that mirrors the input grid vertically.
A4: A4: Here is a Python function that mirrors a grid vertically:

```python
def mirror_grid_vertically(grid):
    return grid[::-1]  # Reverse the order of rows in the grid
```

This function takes a 2D list (grid) as input, and it reverses the order of rows in the grid to create a mirrored grid. The function finally returns the mirrored grid.


Q5: Combine the two functions to create the final output grid.
A5: A5: Here is a Python function that combines the two functions to create the final output grid:

```python
def mirror_grid(grid):
    # Mirror the grid horizontally
    horizontal_mirror = mirror_grid_horizontally(grid)
    # Mirror the grid vertically
    vertical_mirror = mirror_grid_vertically(grid)
    # Combine the two mirrored grids
    final_grid = []
    for i in range(len(horizontal_mirror)):
        final_grid.append(horizontal_mirror[i] + vertical_mirror[i])
    return final_grid
```

This function first mirrors the input grid horizontally and vertically. It then combines the two mirrored grids by appending the elements of the vertically mirrored grid to the corresponding elements of the horizontally mirrored grid. The function finally returns the final grid.

","A5: Here is a Python function that combines the two functions to create the final output grid:

```python
def mirror_grid(grid):
    # Mirror the grid horizontally
    horizontal_mirror = mirror_grid_horizontally(grid)
    # Mirror the grid vertically
    vertical_mirror = mirror_grid_vertically(grid)
    # Combine the two mirrored grids
    final_grid = []
    for i in range(len(horizontal_mirror)):
        final_grid.append(horizontal_mirror[i] + vertical_mirror[i])
    return final_grid
```

This function first mirrors the input grid horizontally and vertically. It then combines the two mirrored grids by appending the elements of the vertically mirrored grid to the corresponding elements of the horizontally mirrored grid. The function finally returns the final grid.",,"[[5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8], [8, 7, 5, 8, 8, 5, 7, 8], [8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8], [5, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5]]",,False,,Medium

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples seems to be related to the count of the number 8 in each row and column. 

In the output grid, the number 2 appears in the position where the number 8 is in the input grid. The number of 2's in each row and column of the output grid is equal to the number of 8's in the corresponding row and column of the input grid. 

Also, the output grid is a 4x4 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid. The first two columns of the output grid correspond to the count of 8's in the first four columns of the input grid, and the last two columns of the output grid correspond to the count of 8's in the last five columns of the input grid. 

The same rule applies to the rows. The first two rows of the output grid correspond to the count of 8's in the first three rows of the input grid, and the last two rows of the output grid correspond to the count of 8's in the last two rows of the input grid. 

If there are no 8's in a certain row or column of the input grid, the corresponding row or column of the output grid will be filled with 0's.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a 4x4 grid, which is smaller than the input grid.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is always a 4x4 grid, regardless of the size of the input grid. This is because the transformation rule involves counting the number of 8's in certain sections of the input grid and representing this count as 2's in the output grid. The input grid is divided into four sections (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right), and the count of 8's in each section is represented in the corresponding section of the output grid. 

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is 
[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], 
 [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], 
 [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], 
 [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]],

then the output grid would be 
[[2, 2, 0, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2]].


Q3: Observe that the output grid is formed by dividing the input grid into 4 equal parts and replacing each part with a single value.
A3: A3: Yes, the output grid is formed by dividing the input grid into four sections and replacing each section with a single value. This value is the count of the number 8 in that section of the input grid, represented as the number 2 in the output grid. If there are no 8's in a certain section of the input grid, the corresponding section of the output grid will be filled with 0's.


Q4: Notice that the value 2 in the output grid corresponds to the presence of the value 8 in the corresponding part of the input grid.
A4: A4: Yes, that's correct. The number 2 in the output grid represents the presence of the number 8 in the corresponding section of the input grid. The number of 2's in each section of the output grid is equal to the number of 8's in the corresponding section of the input grid. If there are no 8's in a certain section of the input grid, the corresponding section of the output grid will be filled with 0's.


Q5: Apply the rules determined in Q2, Q3 and Q4 to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A5: A5: Applying the rules determined in Q2, Q3 and Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we can generate the output grid. 

First, we divide the input grid into four sections and count the number of 8's in each section. 

The input grid is:
[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], 
 [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], 
 [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], 
 [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]]

The count of 8's in each section is:
Top left: 6
Top right: 6
Bottom left: 6
Bottom right: 6

Then, we replace each section of the input grid with the count of 8's in that section, represented as the number 2 in the output grid. 

So, the output grid is:
[[2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2]]

","A5: Applying the rules determined in Q2, Q3 and Q4 to the input grid of the quiz, we can generate the output grid. 

First, we divide the input grid into four sections and count the number of 8's in each section. 

The input grid is:
[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5], 
 [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5], 
 [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5], 
 [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]]

The count of 8's in each section is:
Top left: 6
Top right: 6
Bottom left: 6
Bottom right: 6

Then, we replace each section of the input grid with the count of 8's in that section, represented as the number 2 in the output grid. 

So, the output grid is:

 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2], 
 [2, 2, 2, 2]]","[[0, 8, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0],  [0, 8, 0, 8, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5],  [8, 8, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5],  [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 5],  [0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 5, 0, 5, 0]]The count of 8's in each section is:Top left: 6Top right: 6Bottom left: 6Bottom right: 6Then, we replace each section of the input grid with the count of 8's in that section, represented as the number 2 in the output grid.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========
Q1: Identify the positions of the non-zero numbers in the input grid.
A1: The positions of the non-zero numbers in the input grid are as follows:

- The number 8 is at position (3, 3).
- The number 2 is at position (5, 7).
- The number 1 is at position (10, 12).
- The number 3 is at position (13, 10).


Q2: For each non-zero number, fill the entire row and column with that number.
A2: A2: Yes, for each non-zero number, fill the entire row and column with that number. But also, keep the other numbers' row and column intact. This means that if a row or column is already filled with a non-zero number, it should not be overwritten by another non-zero number. The output grid will look like this:

[[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]


Q3: For each non-zero number, keep the original position of the number as zero.
A3: A3: Yes, for each non-zero number, we should keep the original position of the number as zero. This means that the position where the non-zero number was originally located in the input grid should remain zero in the output grid. The final output grid will look like this:

[[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Q2: Change the color of the identified cells to the color of the surrounding cells.
A2: A2: The color of the identified cells is changed to the color of the surrounding cells as follows:

- The cells at (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5) are changed to color 0 because they are surrounded by color 4 and there is no cell diagonally adjacent to the top left.
- The cells at (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 7), (8, 8) are changed to color 0 because they are surrounded by color 4 and the cell diagonally adjacent to the top left is color 0.
- The cells at (10, 9), (11, 9), (12, 9), (13, 9), (14, 9), (15, 9), (16, 9), (17, 9), (18, 9), (19, 9), (20, 9), (21, 9), (22, 9), (23, 9), (24, 9) are changed to color 0 because they are surrounded by color 1 and there is no cell diagonally adjacent to the top left.


Q3: Identify the cells that are surrounded by a different color on all four sides.
A3: A3: The cells that are surrounded by a different color on all four sides are:

- (3, 3) surrounded by color 4
- (3, 4) surrounded by color 4
- (3, 5) surrounded by color 4
- (4, 3) surrounded by color 4
- (4, 4) surrounded by color 4
- (4, 5) surrounded by color 4
- (5, 3) surrounded by color 4

- (22, 9) surrounded by color 1
- (23, 9) surrounded by color 1
- (24, 9) surrounded by color 1

These cells are not surrounded by the same color on all four sides, so they do not change color according to the rule.


Q4: Change the color of the identified cells to the color of the surrounding cells.
A4: A4: According to the rule, the color of the identified cells should not change because they are not surrounded by the same color on all four sides. Therefore, the output grid remains the same as the input grid.


Q5: Repeat the process until all cells are either the same color as their surrounding cells or have been changed to the color of their surrounding cells.
A5: A5: The process is repeated until all cells are either the same color as their surrounding cells or have been changed to the color of their surrounding cells. In this case, the process is completed after one iteration, as all cells that were surrounded by the same color on all four sides have been changed to the color of their surrounding cells.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

A1: The ARC problem is a type of problem in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a dataset introduced by François Chollet, the creator of the Keras deep learning library. The ARC problem involves identifying patterns in a given input grid and applying these patterns to transform the grid into an output grid.

In the given problem, the pattern seems to involve identifying cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 6s. However, the problem statement does not provide enough information to determine how to identify these cells or what to do with them once they are identified. 

In the examples provided, it appears that the transformation involves shifting the values in the grid to the right. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine the exact pattern or rule that should be applied. 

In the context of the ARC, these problems are typically solved using machine learning algorithms that can learn to identify and apply these patterns based on a set of training examples. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to provide a specific solution to this problem.


Q2: Change the color of the cells identified in Q1 to 6.
A2: A2: The problem statement does not provide a clear method for identifying which cells are surrounded by 6s. However, if we assume that a cell is considered ""surrounded"" if it has a 6 in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right), then we could use the following approach:

1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. For each cell, check the value of the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If any of these cells contain a 6, change the value of the current cell to 6.

This approach would result in all cells that are adjacent to a 6 being changed to a 6. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine if this is the correct approach for this problem.


Q3: Identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 8s.
A3: A3: Similar to the previous question, the problem statement does not provide a clear method for identifying which cells are surrounded by 8s. However, if we assume that a cell is considered ""surrounded"" if it has an 8 in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right), then we could use the following approach:

1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. For each cell, check the value of the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If any of these cells contain an 8, mark the current cell as surrounded by 8s.

This approach would result in all cells that are adjacent to an 8 being marked as surrounded by 8s. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine if this is the correct approach for this problem.


Q4: Change the color of the cells identified in Q3 to 8.
A4: A4: Similar to the previous answers, if we assume that a cell is considered ""surrounded"" if it has an 8 in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right), then we could use the following approach:

1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. For each cell, check the value of the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If any of these cells contain an 8, change the value of the current cell to 8.

This approach would result in all cells that are adjacent to an 8 being changed to an 8. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine if this is the correct approach for this problem.


Q5: Identify the cells in the input grid that are surrounded by 9s.
A5: A5: Similar to the previous questions, the problem statement does not provide a clear method for identifying which cells are surrounded by 9s. However, if we assume that a cell is considered ""surrounded"" if it has a 9 in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right), then we could use the following approach:

1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. For each cell, check the value of the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If any of these cells contain a 9, mark the current cell as surrounded by 9s.

This approach would result in all cells that are adjacent to a 9 being marked as surrounded by 9s. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine if this is the correct approach for this problem.


Q6: Change the color of the cells identified in Q5 to 9.
A6: A6: Similar to the previous answers, if we assume that a cell is considered ""surrounded"" if it has a 9 in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right), then we could use the following approach:

1. Iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. For each cell, check the value of the cells in the up, down, left, and right directions. If any of these cells contain a 9, change the value of the current cell to 9.

This approach would result in all cells that are adjacent to a 9 being changed to a 9. However, without more information or examples, it is difficult to determine if this is the correct approach for this problem.

Q1: Identify the pattern in the input grids of the examples.
A1: The pattern in the input grids of the examples is that the grids are divided into three sections. The first section contains a pattern of 2s, the second section contains a pattern of 7s, and the third section contains a pattern of 6s. The patterns of 2s and 6s are not always the same, but they are always separated by a row of 7s.


Q2: Identify the pattern in the output grids of the examples.
A2: A2: The pattern in the output grids of the examples is that the grids are always 6 rows by 4 columns. The number 8 appears in the output grids in a pattern that mirrors the pattern of 2s in the corresponding input grid. The rest of the cells in the output grids are filled with 0s.


Q3: How does the pattern in the input grids relate to the pattern in the output grids?.
A3: A3: The pattern in the input grids relates to the pattern in the output grids in that the pattern of 2s in the input grid is mirrored and replaced with 8s in the output grid. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s. The row of 7s in the input grid seems to act as a separator and does not appear in the output grid. The pattern of 6s in the input grid also does not appear in the output grid.


Q4: Identify the sections of the input grid in the quiz that match the pattern identified in Q1.
A4: A4: The sections of the input grid in the quiz that match the pattern identified in Q1 are as follows: The first section contains a pattern of 2s, the second section contains a pattern of 7s, and the third section contains a pattern of 6s. The patterns of 2s and 6s are not the same, but they are always separated by a row of 7s.


Q5: Apply the transformation identified in Q3 to the sections identified in Q4 to generate the output grid.
A5: A5: Applying the transformation identified in Q3 to the sections identified in Q4, we replace the pattern of 2s in the input grid with 8s in the output grid and fill the rest of the cells with 0s. The output grid is as follows:

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the input grid.
A1: The pattern in the input grid is a repeating sequence of numbers in each row, with a block of zeros in the middle of the grid. The sequence repeats every 6 rows, starting from the second row. The sequence is as follows: 2, 8, 1, 5, 5, 1, 8, 2. This sequence is repeated four times in each row, with the exception of the rows containing the block of zeros. The first and last rows, as well as the first and last columns, are filled with 1s.


Q2: Identify the changes in the output grid compared to the input grid.
A2: A2: The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that the block of zeros in the middle of the grid is replaced with the repeating sequence of numbers that is present in the rest of the grid. The sequence is filled in such a way that it continues seamlessly from the sequences in the surrounding rows.


Q3: Identify the conditions for the changes.
A3: A3: The condition for the changes is the presence of the block of zeros in the input grid. The zeros are replaced with the repeating sequence of numbers, continuing from the sequence in the surrounding rows. The sequence is not interrupted or restarted at the beginning of the block of zeros, but continues as if the zeros were not there.


Q4: Apply the identified changes to the input grid of the quiz.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples is as follows:

1. The original input grid is copied to the left half of the output grid.
2. The right half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the left half, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the center column of the input grid, from top to bottom.
3. The bottom half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the top half, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the center row of the input grid, from left to right.

In other words, the transformation involves mirroring and color rotation.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is twice as large as the input grid in both dimensions.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed twice as large as the input grid in both dimensions. This is because the transformation involves copying the input grid to the left half of the output grid, and then creating a mirrored version of this on the right half. Similarly, the top half of the output grid is mirrored to create the bottom half. This effectively doubles the size of the grid in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions.

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is 
[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5]],
then the output grid would be
[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].


Q3: Identify the rule for filling the first half of the output grid.
A3: A3: The rule for filling the first half of the output grid is simply to copy the input grid as it is. The left half of the output grid is an exact replica of the input grid.


Q4: Identify the rule for filling the second half of the output grid.
A4: A4: The rule for filling the second half of the output grid is to create a mirrored version of the left half, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the center column of the input grid, from top to bottom.


Q5: Determine the rule for changing the values in the second half of the output grid.
A5: A5: The rule for changing the values in the second half of the output grid is to rotate the colors of the cells clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the center column of the input grid, from top to bottom. This means that the color of each cell in the second half of the output grid is replaced by the color of the next cell down in the center column of the input grid. If the cell is at the bottom of the column, its color is replaced by the color of the top cell in the column.


Q6: Apply these rules to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A6: A6: Applying these rules to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]].

This output grid is generated by first copying the input grid to the left half of the output grid, then creating a mirrored version of this on the right half with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The bottom half of the output grid is a mirrored version of the top half, but with the colors of the cells rotated clockwise by one step. The rotation of colors is determined by the unique colors in the center row and column of the input grid.

","A6: Applying these rules to the input grid of the quiz, we get the following output grid:

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the positions of the numbers 1, 6, 7, and 3 in the input grid.
A1: The positions of the numbers 1, 6, 7, and 3 in the input grid are as follows:

- Number 1 is located at positions (1, 13), (5, 14), and (7, 7).
- Number 6 is located at positions (0, 4), (1, 1), and (7, 0).
- Number 7 is located at positions (10, 0), (13, 1), and (14, 8).
- Number 3 is located at positions (8, 14), (13, 13), and (14, 11).


Q2: Determine the range of rows and columns that are filled with the number 5.
A2: A2: The range of rows filled with the number 5 is from row 1 to row 13. The range of columns filled with the number 5 is from column 1 to column 13.


Q3: Divide the range of rows filled with the number 5 into three equal parts.
A3: A3: The range of rows filled with the number 5 is from row 1 to row 13, which is a total of 13 rows. If we divide this range into three equal parts, each part will contain approximately 4.33 rows. Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can approximate this to 4 rows per part. Therefore, the three parts will be from row 1 to row 4, row 5 to row 8, and row 9 to row 13.


Q4: Replace the first third of the rows filled with the number 5 with the number identified at the top of the grid (from Q1).
A4: A4: The number identified at the top of the grid from Q1 is 6. Therefore, replace the first third of the rows filled with the number 5 (from row 1 to row 4) with the number 6.


Q5: Replace the last third of the rows filled with the number 5 with the number identified at the bottom of the grid (from Q1).
A5: A5: The number identified at the bottom of the grid from Q1 is 7. Therefore, replace the last third of the rows filled with the number 5 (from row 9 to row 13) with the number 7.

Q6: Replace the middle third of the rows filled with the number 5 with the number identified in the middle of the grid (from Q1).
A6: The number identified in the middle of the grid from Q1 is 1. Therefore, replace the middle third of the rows filled with the number 5 (from row 5 to row 8) with the number 1.

Q7: Apply the same process to the columns filled with the number 5.
A7: The numbers identified at the left, middle, and right of the grid from Q1 are 6, 1, and 3, respectively. Therefore, replace the first third of the columns filled with the number 5 (from column 1 to column 4) with the number 6, the middle third (from column 5 to column 8) with the number 1, and the last third (from column 9 to column 13) with the number 3.

The final output grid should look like this:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 0],

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]]


Q6: Keep the middle third of the rows filled with the number 5 unchanged.
A6: A6: The middle third of the rows filled with the number 5 (from row 5 to row 8) should remain unchanged. Therefore, these rows will still contain the number 5.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples is as follows:

1. The grid is divided into two halves vertically by the column containing the number 2. 

2. The left half of the grid is transformed into a new grid where all non-zero numbers are replaced by 1 and zero remains as zero. 

3. The right half of the grid is discarded.

4. The new grid is a 5x6 grid, which is the left half of the original grid after the transformation. 

This pattern is consistent across all the examples.


Q2: Notice that the output grid is a smaller version of the input grid.
A2: A2: Yes, the output grid is indeed a smaller version of the input grid. This is because the transformation process involves discarding the right half of the input grid and only keeping the left half. The numbers in the left half are then replaced by 1s (if they were non-zero) or 0s (if they were already 0), resulting in a smaller, simplified version of the original grid. 

Quiz Answer:

then the output grid would be 
[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]].


Q3: Identify the role of the number 2 in the input grid.
A3: A3: The number 2 in the input grid serves as a divider or boundary between the two halves of the grid. It is always located in the middle column of the input grid, effectively splitting the grid into a left half and a right half. The transformation process only keeps the left half of the grid, while the right half (including the column with the number 2) is discarded.


Q4: Notice that the output grid only contains the numbers 0 and 1.
A4: A4: Yes, the output grid only contains the numbers 0 and 1. This is because the transformation process involves replacing all non-zero numbers in the left half of the input grid with 1, while zero remains as zero. This simplifies the grid and reduces the variety of numbers in it, resulting in an output grid that only contains 0s and 1s.


Q5: Apply the identified transformation rules to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A5: A5: To generate the output grid from the input grid of the quiz, we first split the input grid into two halves vertically at the column containing the number 2. We then discard the right half of the grid. For the left half, we replace all non-zero numbers with 1 and leave the zeros as they are. 

So, if the input grid is 
[[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]],
then the output grid would be 
[[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]].

","A5: To generate the output grid from the input grid of the quiz, we first split the input grid into two halves vertically at the column containing the number 2.

Q1: Identify the pattern of the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern of the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the examples seems to be as follows:

1. The grid is divided into two halves horizontally. The top half contains the number 9 and the bottom half contains the number 4.

2. The number of 9s in each row of the top half is counted and replaced with the number 6 in the corresponding position in the output grid. The same is done for the number 4s in the bottom half.

3. The output grid is a 3x5 grid, which is half the size of the input grid. The first row of the output grid corresponds to the first two rows of the input grid, the second row corresponds to the next two rows, and the third row corresponds to the last two rows.

4. If a row in the input grid does not contain any 9s or 4s, it is represented as a row of 0s in the output grid.

5. The position of the 6s in the output grid does not correspond to the position of the 9s in the input grid. Instead, the 6s are placed in the output grid in such a way that they form a mirror image of the 9s in the input grid. The same is true for the 4s and 6s in the bottom half of the grid.


Q2: Determine the rule for the size reduction of the grid.
A2: A2: The rule for the size reduction of the grid is that the output grid is half the size of the input grid in terms of the number of rows. The input grid has 6 rows and the output grid has 3 rows. The number of columns remains the same. This is achieved by combining every two rows from the input grid into one row in the output grid.


Q3: Determine the rule for the transformation of the numbers.
A3: A3: The rule for the transformation of the numbers is as follows:

1. The number 9 in the top half of the input grid and the number 4 in the bottom half are replaced with the number 6 in the output grid.

2. The number of 9s in each row of the top half of the input grid is counted and replaced with the same number of 6s in the corresponding position in the output grid. The same is done for the number 4s in the bottom half.

3. The position of the 6s in the output grid does not correspond to the position of the 9s in the input grid. Instead, the 6s are placed in the output grid in such a way that they form a mirror image of the 9s in the input grid. The same is true for the 4s and 6s in the bottom half of the grid.

4. If a row in the input grid does not contain any 9s or 4s, it is represented as a row of 0s in the output grid.

Quiz Answer: 
If the input grid is 
[[9, 9, 0, 9, 0], [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 0, 4], [4, 0, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]],
then the output grid would be
[[0, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6]].


Q4: Apply these rules to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.
A4: A4: To apply these rules to the input grid of the quiz, we first divide the grid into two halves. The top half is:

[[9, 9, 0, 9, 0], 
 [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], 
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9]]

And the bottom half is:

[[4, 4, 4, 0, 4], 
 [4, 0, 4, 4, 4], 
 [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]]

We then count the number of 9s in each row of the top half and replace them with 6s in the output grid. The first row has three 9s, so we place three 6s in the first row of the output grid. The second row has two 9s, so we place two 6s in the second row. The third row has two 9s, so we place two 6s in the third row. 

We do the same for the number 4s in the bottom half. The first row has four 4s, so we place four 6s in the first row of the output grid. The second row has three 4s, so we place three 6s in the second row. The third row has two 4s, so we place two 6s in the third row.

Finally, we place the 6s in the output grid in such a way that they form a mirror image of the 9s in the input grid. The same is true for the 4s and 6s in the bottom half of the grid.

So, the output grid is:

[[0, 6, 6, 6, 0], 
 [0, 0, 6, 0, 6], 
 [6, 6, 6, 0, 6]]

","A4: To apply these rules to the input grid of the quiz, we first divide the grid into two halves. The top half is:

[[9, 9, 0, 9, 0], 
 [0, 0, 9, 0, 9], 
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9]]

And the bottom half is:

[[4, 4, 4, 0, 4], 
 [4, 0, 4, 4, 4], 
 [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]]

We then count the number of 9s in each row of the top half and replace them with 6s in the output grid. The first row has three 9s, so we place three 6s in the first row of the output grid. The second row has two 9s, so we place two 6s in the second row. The third row has two 9s, so we place two 6s in the third row. 

We do the same for the number 4s in the bottom half. The first row has four 4s, so we place four 6s in the first row of the output grid. The second row has three 4s, so we place three 6s in the second row. The third row has two 4s, so we place two 6s in the third row.

Finally, we place the 6s in the output grid in such a way that they form a mirror image of the 9s in the input grid. The same is true for the 4s and 6s in the bottom half of the grid.

So, the output grid is:

[[0, 6, 6, 6, 0], 
 [0, 0, 6, 0, 6], 
 [6, 6, 6, 0, 6]]","[[9, 9, 0, 9, 0],  [0, 0, 9, 0, 9],  [0, 0, 0, 9, 9]]And the bottom half is:[[4, 4, 4, 0, 4],  [4, 0, 4, 4, 4],  [4, 4, 0, 0, 0]]We then count the number of 9s in each row of the top half and replace them with 6s in the output grid. The first row has three 9s, so we place three 6s in the first row of the output grid. The second row has two 9s, so we place two 6s in the second row. The third row has two 9s, so we place two 6s in the third row. We do the same for the number 4s in the bottom half. The first row has four 4s, so we place four 6s in the first row of the output grid. The second row has three 4s, so we place three 6s in the second row. The third row has two 4s, so we place two 6s in the third row.Finally, we place the 6s in the output grid in such a way that they form a mirror image of the 9s in the input grid. The same is true for the 4s and 6s in the bottom half of the grid.So, the output grid is:[[0, 6, 6, 6, 0],  [0, 0, 6, 0, 6],  [6, 6, 6, 0, 6]]","[[0, 0, 6, 6, 6], [6, 0, 0, 6, 0], [6, 6, 0, 6, 6]]","[[0, 6, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [6, 6, 6, 0, 6]]",False,,Multiple solutions

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

=========
Q1: Identify the rows and columns where the number 7 is located in the input grid.
A1: The number 7 is located in the rows 1 to 13 (inclusive) and columns 4 to 10 (inclusive) in the input grid.


Q2: Identify the pattern of the number 7 in the input grid.
A2: A2: The pattern of the number 7 in the input grid forms a rectangle. The top and bottom rows of the rectangle are filled with 7s, while the middle rows have 7s only at the 4th, 7th, and 10th columns.


Q3: Determine the transformation rule from the input grid to the output grid based on the examples.
A3: A3: The transformation rule from the input grid to the output grid is that the rectangle of 7s rotates 90 degrees clockwise around its center. The top and bottom rows of the rectangle become the left and right columns, and the middle rows with 7s only at the 4th, 7th, and 10th columns become the middle columns with 7s only at the 4th, 7th, and 10th rows.


Q4: Apply the transformation rule to the input grid of the quiz to generate the output grid.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Quiz
If input grids are like that
[[9, 7, 9], [9, 9, 7], [7, 9, 7]],
then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A1: The pattern in the transformation of the input grid to the output grid is as follows:

1. The input grid is a 3x3 matrix. The output grid is a 9x9 matrix.

2. The input grid is replicated three times in the output grid - once at the top left, once in the middle, and once at the bottom right.

3. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s. 

This pattern is consistent across all the examples.


Q2: Notice that the input grid is replicated and placed in different positions in the output grid.
A2: A2: Yes, the input grid is replicated and placed in three different positions in the output grid. The first replication is placed at the top left corner of the output grid, the second replication is placed in the middle of the output grid, and the third replication is placed at the bottom right corner of the output grid. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with 0s.

Quiz Answer:
If the input grid is 
[[9, 7, 9], [9, 9, 7], [7, 9, 7]],
then the output grid would be
[[9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7]].


Q3: Determine the positions where the input grid is placed in the output grid.
A3: A3: The input grid is placed in three positions in the output grid:

1. The top left corner of the output grid. This is the first 3x3 block in the output grid.

2. The center of the output grid. This is the 3x3 block starting from the 4th row and 4th column in the output grid.

3. The bottom right corner of the output grid. This is the last 3x3 block in the output grid.


Q4: Create a 9x9 grid filled with zeros.
A4: A4: Here is a 9x9 grid filled with zeros:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]


Q5: Place the input grid in the positions determined in Q3 on the 9x9 grid.
A5: A5: To place the input grid in the positions determined in Q3 on the 9x9 grid, we can follow these steps:

1. For the top left corner, replace the first 3x3 block in the 9x9 grid with the input grid.

2. For the center, replace the 3x3 block starting from the 4th row and 4th column in the 9x9 grid with the input grid.

3. For the bottom right corner, replace the last 3x3 block in the 9x9 grid with the input grid.

So, if the input grid is [[9, 7, 9], [9, 9, 7], [7, 9, 7]], the 9x9 grid after placing the input grid in the determined positions would be:

[[9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 7, 9], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 7], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 7]]


Q6: The resulting grid from Q5 is the output grid.
A6: A6: Yes, the resulting grid from Q5 is indeed the output grid. The transformation of the input grid to the output grid involves replicating the input grid and placing it in three specific positions in the output grid, while the rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with 0s. This pattern is consistent across all the examples and can be applied to any 3x3 input grid to generate the corresponding 9x9 output grid.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the positions of the number 5 in the input grid.
A1: A1: The number 5 is located at the positions (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3) in the input grid.


Q2: For each position of 5, create a 2x2 grid with alternating 1 and 2 starting with 1 at the top left corner.
A2: A2: For each position of 5, the 2x2 grid would look like this:

[[1, 2],
 [2, 1]]

Q3: Replace each position of 5 in the input grid with the 2x2 grid created in step 2.
A3: Replacing each position of 5 in the input grid with the 2x2 grid, the output grid would look like this:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]]


Q3: Combine these 2x2 grids to form the output grid, maintaining the relative positions of the original 5s in the input grid.
A3: A3: Combining these 2x2 grids while maintaining the relative positions of the original 5s in the input grid, the output grid would look like this:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2],
 [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]


Q4: For positions in the input grid that do not contain a 5, fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with 0s.
A4: A4: Filling the positions in the output grid that correspond to non-5 positions in the input grid with 0s, the final output grid would look like this:

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0],

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

then output grids?

=========
Q1: Identify the pattern of the numbers in the input grid.
A1: The pattern in the input grid is that there are groups of numbers (representing different colors) forming different shapes. The shapes are isolated from each other and surrounded by zeros. The shapes include lines and rectangles. The numbers within the same shape are the same.


Q2: Identify the changes in the numbers from the input grid to the output grid in the examples.
A2: A2: The changes from the input grid to the output grid involve the transformation of the numbers within the shapes. The numbers within the same shape in the input grid are changed to a different number in the output grid. The shapes and their positions remain the same. The transformation rule seems to be: 8 to 2, 3 to 1, 4 to 3, 2 to 4, and 1 to 3.


Q3: Identify the pattern of the numbers in the quiz input grid.
A3: A3: The pattern in the quiz input grid is similar to the examples. There are groups of numbers (representing different colors) forming different shapes. The shapes are isolated from each other and surrounded by zeros. The shapes include lines and rectangles. The numbers within the same shape are the same. The numbers used in the quiz input grid are 8, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.

Do you know ARC problem?

It is similary below.

=========
Example 1

If input grids are like that
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then this grids change to output grids below
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

=========

You can understand the pattern of this problem with input-output pair about example1.
In above case, you can inference like below.

In example 1 case, all obejct move right. So if given input is below,
[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
then you can move object to right side.
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]].

Like this concept, 'object', 'count', 'color', 'move', 'row', 'column' and etc, helps you to understand patterns of problem and solve it.

Below problem is other pattern to solve. So you can understand below pattern with several examples and apply quiz's input to get right output.
